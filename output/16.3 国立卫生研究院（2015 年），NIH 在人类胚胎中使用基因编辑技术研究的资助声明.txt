Genomic editing is an area of research seeking to modify genes of living organisms to improve our understanding of gene function and advance potential therapeutic applications to correct genetic abnormalities
Researchers in China have recently described their experiments in a nonviable human embryo to modify the gene responsible for a potentially fatal blood disorder using a gene-editing technology called CRISPR/Cas9
Genomic editing is already widely studied in a variety of organisms
In the first clinical application of genomic editing, a related genome editing technique (using a zinc finger nuclease) was used to create HIV-1 resistance in human immune cells, bringing HIV viral load down to undetectable levels in at least one individual
All of these examples of research using genomic editing technologies can and are being funded by NIH
However, NIH will not fund any use of gene-editing technologies in human embryos
Advances in technology have given us an elegant new way of carrying out genome editing, but the strong arguments against engaging in this activity remain
The Public Health Service Act and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act give the FDA the authority to regulate cell and gene therapy products as biological products and/or drugs, which would include oversight of human germline modification
