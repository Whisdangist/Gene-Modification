For example, if the genetic modification has the objective of increasing
(2) neither parental transgenic rodent contains the following genetic modifications: (i) incorporation of more than
gene-modified autologous tumor cells will then be injected into the thigh of the patient
engendered by the injection of the gene modified tumor cells themselves as well as after the infusion of the
genetically modified, adoptively transferred CTL cells
response, the gene coding for Interleukin-2 (IL-2) will be used to transduce tumor cells, and these gene-modified
injections of gene-modified fibroblasts, (2) examine the local and systemic immunomodulatory effects of these
injections of 5 x 106 irradiated gene modified autologous tumor cells
or other effective antiviral agents is lost as a result of genetic modification or serial passage of a mammaliantransmissible HPAI H5N1 virus, then any research with this antiviral agent resistant virus shall be stopped
