genetically modified organisms.
2 Any person who causes measures to be taken under the provisions of this Act shall
bear the costs.
Art. 3 Area of validity
1 This Act applies to the handling of genetically modified animals, plants and other
organisms, as well as their metabolic products and wastes.
2 For products obtained from genetically modified organisms, only the regulations
on labelling and provision of public information (Art. 17 and 18) apply.
Art. 4 Reservation of other laws
More detailed provisions in other federal laws concerning the protection of human
beings, animals and the environment from hazards or harm caused by genetically
modified organisms are reserved.
Art. 5 Definitions
1 Organisms means cellular or non-cellular biological entities capable of replication
or of transferring genetic material. Mixtures, articles and products that contain such
entities are also regarded as organisms.
2 Genetically modified organism means organisms in which the genetic material has
been altered in a way that does not occur under natural conditions by crossing or
natural recombination.
3 Harm: means any harmful effect or nuisance caused by genetically modified
organisms to human beings, animals or the environment.
4 Handling means any activity undertaken in connection with organisms, in particular their production, experimental release, putting into circulation, import, export,
keeping, use, storage, transport or disposal.
5 Putting into circulation means any supply of organisms to third parties in Switzerland, in particular by sale, exchange, giving as a gift, renting, lending or sending on
approval, as well as their import; supply for activities in contained systems or experimental release does not count as putting into circulation.

modifications to the land. Appliances, machines, vehicles, ships and aircraft are also
regarded as installations.
Chapter 2: Handling Genetically Modified Organisms
Section 1: General Principles
Art. 6 Protection of human beings, animals, environment and biological
diversity
1 Genetically modified organisms may only be handled in such a way that they, their
metabolic products or wastes:
a. cannot endanger human beings, animals or the environment;
b. do not harm biological diversity or the sustainable use thereof.
2 Genetically modified organisms may be released for experimental purposes if:
a. the information sought cannot be obtained through experiments in contained
systems;
b. the experiment also contributes to research on the biosafety of genetically
modified organisms;
c. they do not contain genes inserted by gene technology which cause resistance to antibiotics used in human or veterinary medicine; and
d. according to the current state of knowledge, the dispersal of these organisms
and their new traits can be excluded and the principles of paragraph 1 cannot
otherwise be contravened.
3 Genetically modified organisms lawfully intended for use in the environment may
only be put into circulation if they do not contain gene technologically inserted
resistance genes to antibiotics used in human or veterinary medicine, and if experiments in contained systems and field trials have shown that they:
a. do not harm the population of protected organisms or organisms that are important for the ecosystem in question;
b. do not lead to the unintended extinction of a species of organism;
c. do not severely or permanently harm the material balance of the environment;
d. do not severely or permanently harm any important functions of the ecosystem in question, and in particular the fertility of the soil;
e. do not disperse or spread their traits in an undesired way; and
f. do not otherwise contravene the principles of paragraph 1.
4 Hazards and harm must be evaluated both individually and as a whole and in terms
of their interaction; connections to other hazards and harm from causes other than
genetically modified organisms should also be considered. 
Protection of the Ecological Balance

814.91
Art. 7 Protection of production without genetically modified organisms and
freedom of choice
Genetically modified organisms may be handled only in such a way that they, their
metabolic products or wastes do not impair production that does not involve genetically modified organisms, or limit consumers’ freedom of choice.
Art. 8 Respect for the dignity of living beings
1 In animals and plants, modification of the genetic material by gene technology
must not violate the dignity of living beings. In particular, violation is deemed to
have occurred if such modification substantially harms species-specific properties,
functions or habits, unless this is justified by overriding legitimate interests. In
evaluating the harm, the difference between animals and plants must be taken into
consideration.
2 Whether the dignity of living beings has been respected is determined on a caseby-case basis, by evaluating the severity of the harm suffered by animals or plants
against the significance of the legitimate interests. Legitimate interests are, in particular:
a. human and animal health;
b. guaranteeing food security;
c. the reduction of harm caused to the environment;
d. the preservation and improvement of environmental conditions;
e. securing a substantial economic, social or environmental benefit for society;
f. increasing knowledge.
3 The Federal Council determines the conditions under which genetic modifications
to the genetic material are exceptionally permissible without a weighing of interests.
Art. 9 Genetic modification of vertebrates
Genetically modified vertebrates may only be produced and put into circulation for
purposes of research, therapy, or diagnostics in human or veterinary medicine.
Art. 10 Activities in contained systems
1 Any person who handles genetically modified organisms which may not be released for experimental purposes (Art. 11) nor put into circulation (Art. 12) is required to take all containment measures necessary in particular due to the hazards
for human beings, animals or the environment that these organisms represent.
2 The Federal Council shall introduce a notification or authorisation procedure for
activities in contained systems.

814.91
Art. 11 Experimental releases
1 Any person who intends to release for experimental purposes genetically modified
organisms which may not be put into circulation for use in the environment (Art. 12)
requires federal authorisation.
2 The Federal Council determines the requirements and the procedure. In particular,
it regulates:
a. the consultation of experts;
b. the guarantee of funding for measures with which any hazards or harm can
be identified, averted or eliminated;
c. the provision of information for the public.
Art. 12 Putting into circulation
1 Genetically modified organisms may be put into circulation only if the Confederation has granted authorisation.
2 The Federal Council determines the requirements and the procedure, and regulates
the provision of information to the public.
Art. 12a7 Opposition procedure
1 Applications for authorisations for experimental releases of genetically modified
organisms and for putting into circulation genetically modified organisms for lawful
use in the environment are published by the authorising authority in the Official
Federal Gazette and made available for public inspection for 30 days.
2 Any person who is a party in accordance with the Federal Act of 20 December
19688 on Administrative Procedure may file opposition with the authorising authority during the inspection period. A party who fails to file opposition is excluded from
subsequent proceedings.
Art. 13 Inspection of authorisations
1 Authorisations are regularly inspected to determine whether they may continue to
apply.
2 Authorised persons must voluntarily inform the authorising authority of new
findings that could lead to a re-evaluation of hazards or harm as soon as they become aware of these findings.

Art. 14 Exceptions to the notification or authorisation requirement;
self-supervision
1 The Federal Council may simplify the requirement to notify or obtain authorisation
or may grant exemptions if, according to the current state of knowledge or experience, a violation of the principles of Articles 6–9 can be excluded.
2 If there is no authorisation requirement for an activity in contained systems or for
putting into circulation certain genetically modified organisms, the person or company responsible shall monitor compliance with the principles of Articles 6–9 themselves. The Federal Council enacts regulations covering the form, extent and monitoring of the self-supervision.
Section 2: Special Provisions
Art. 15 Informing the recipients
1 Any person putting organisms into circulation must:
a. inform the recipient of the properties that are significant for the implementation of Articles 6–9;
b. instruct the recipient in such a way that the principles of Articles 6–9 are not
violated if the organisms are handled appropriately.
2 Instructions from producers and importers must be followed.
3 The supply to agricultural or forestry enterprises9 of genetically modified organisms that are subject to a labelling requirement requires the written permission of the
enterprise owner.
Art. 16 Product flow segregation
1 Any person handling genetically modified organisms must take appropriate care to
avoid undesired mixing with non-genetically modified organisms.
2 The Federal Council enacts regulations on product flow segregation and on
measures to prevent contamination, taking account of international recommendations and foreign trade relations.
Art. 17 Labelling
1 Any person putting genetically modified organisms into circulation must label
them as such for the benefit of the recipient, in order to ensure freedom of choice for
the consumer under Article 7 and to prevent product fraud. The labelling must
contain the words “genetically modified”. The Federal Council determines the
details.

9 Expression in accordance with No I of the Federal Act of 19 March 2010, in force since

2 The Federal Council lays down threshold values below which labelling is unnecessary for mixtures, articles and products that unintentionally contain traces of genetically modified organisms.
3 Traces of genetically modified organisms are considered to be unintentional if the
person responsible for providing labelling proves that the product flows have been
carefully monitored and recorded.
4 The Federal Council regulates the labelling of products, in particular of foodstuffs
and additives obtained from genetically modified organisms.
5 It regulates how organisms that are not genetically modified may be labelled as
such when they are put into circulation. It also enacts regulations concerning protection from any misuse of such labelling.
6 In enacting the provisions of this Article, the Federal Council takes account of
international recommendations and foreign trade relations.
Art. 18 Access to files and public information
1 The right to access information in official documents relating to the handling of
genetically modified organisms or products obtained from them is governed by
Article 10g of the Environmental Protection Act of 7 October 198310.11
2 After consulting the affected party, the authorities may publish information gathered during enforcement (Art. 24 para. 1) and results from surveys or monitoring,
insofar as these are of general interest. They may pass on this information in accordance with a federal act or international agreement to a foreign authority or international organisation. Manufacturing and trade secrecy are reserved.
Art. 19 Further Federal Council regulations
1 The Federal Council enacts further regulations governing the handling of genetically modified organisms, their metabolic products and wastes if, due to their properties, methods of use or quantities used, the principles of Articles 6–9 could be
contravened.
2 In particular, it may:
a. regulate their transport, import, export and transit;
b. ban or restrict the handling of certain organisms or establish an authorisation
procedure for handling them;
c. prescribe measures to combat certain organisms or to prevent their occurrence;

Chapter 3: Enforcement
Art. 20 Enforcement powers
1 The Confederation enforces this Act. The Federal Council enacts implementing
regulations.
2 The Federal Council may delegate certain enforcement tasks under this Act to the
cantons insofar as these tasks have not already been allocated to them under other
federal acts, relating in particular to the handling of articles and products.
3 The Federal Council may also pass on certain enforcement tasks to organisations
and persons under public or private law.
4 The costs of measures that the authorities take to avert immediate hazards or harm,
and the costs incurred in determining and remediating the same are passed on to the
perpetrator.
Art. 21 Coordination of enforcement
1 The federal authority carrying out the enforcement of regulations on genetically
modified organisms on the basis of another federal act or an international treaty, is
also responsible in doing so for enforcing this Act. The federal authorities make
their decisions with the agreement of the other federal agencies concerned and,
where federal law provides, after consulting the cantons concerned.
2 If the handling of genetically modified organisms is subject, in addition to a federal
notification or authorisation procedure, to a cantonal planning and authorisation
procedure, the Federal Council designates a competent authority to coordinate these
procedures.
Art. 22 Swiss Expert Committee for Biosafety
1 The Federal Council appoints a Swiss Expert Committee for Biosafety, comprising
experts from the various interested sectors. The interests of protection and use must
be appropriately represented.
2 The Expert Committee advises the Federal Council on issues of biosafety that arise
in enacting regulations, and the authorities on their enforcement. It is consulted on
authorisation applications. It may publish recommendations on these applications; in
important and justified cases, it may commission expert opinions and inquiries.
3 It collaborates with other federal and cantonal committees concerned with issues of
biotechnology.
4 It engages in public dialogue, and makes periodic reports to the Federal Council
about its activities.

authorities and if necessary to carry out or permit inquiries.
2 The Federal Council may require registers with data about the type, quantity and
evaluation of genetically modified organisms to be kept, stored and made available
at the request of the authorities.
3 The Confederation carries out surveys of the handling of genetically modified
organisms. The Federal Council determines which data about genetically modified
organisms, recorded in pursuance of other federal acts, must be provided to the
federal authority carrying out the survey.
4 Where there is a legitimate interest in keeping data secret, such as information
about trade and manufacturing secrets, such data is treated as confidential.
Art. 25 Fees
The Federal Council sets the fees for enforcement by the federal authorities and may
determine the framework for cantonal fees. It may grant exemptions from fee payment.

territory from neighbouring cantons is disputed.
Chapter 5: Liability
Art. 30 Principles
1 Any person subject to the authorisation or notification requirement who handles
genetically modified organisms in contained systems, releases such organisms for
experimental purposes or puts them into circulation without permission is liable for
any loss or damage that occurs during this handling that is due to the genetic modification.
2 The person subject to the authorisation requirement is solely liable for any loss or
damage that occurs to agricultural or forestry enterprises or to consumers of products of these enterprises through the permitted putting into circulation of genetically

modified organisms that is a result of the modification of genetic material if the
organisms:
a. are contained in agricultural or forestry inputs14; or
b. stem from such inputs.
3 In relation to liability under paragraph 2, recourse against persons who have handled such organisms inappropriately or have otherwise contributed to the occurrence
or exacerbation of the loss or damage is reserved.
4 If any loss or damage is caused by any other permitted putting into circulation of
genetically modified organisms as a result of the modification of the genetic material, the person subject to the authorisation requirement is liable if the organisms are
defective. He or she is also liable for a defect which, according to the state of
knowledge and technology at the time when the organism was put into circulation,
could not have been recognised.
5 Genetically modified organisms are defective if they do not provide the safety that
is to be expected taking all circumstances into account; in particular:
a. the way in which they are presented to the public;
b. the use that can reasonably be expected;
c. the time at which they were put into circulation.
6 A product made from genetically modified organisms is not considered defective
for the sole reason that an improved product has later been put into circulation.
7 The loss or damage must have been caused as a result of:
a. the new properties of the organisms;
b. the reproduction or modification of the organisms; or
c. the transmission of the modified genetic material of the organisms.
8 A person is exempt from liability if he or she can prove that the loss or damage
was caused by an Act of God or through gross misconduct by the injured party or a
third party.
9 Articles 42–47 and 49–53 of the Swiss Code of Obligations15 apply.
10 The Confederation, cantons and communes are also liable in accordance with
paragraphs 1–9.
Art. 31 Damage to the environment
1 The person who is liable for handling genetically modified organisms must also
reimburse the costs of necessary and appropriate measures that are taken to repair
destroyed or damaged environmental components, or to replace them with components of equal value.

14 Expression in accordance with No I of the Federal Act of 19 March 2010, in force since

2 If the destroyed or damaged environmental components are not the object of a right
in rem or if the eligible person does not take the measures that the situation calls for,
the damages are awarded to the community responsible.
Art. 32 Limitation
1 The right to claim damages expires after three years from the time when the injured party becomes aware of the loss or damage and of the person liable, but at the
latest after 30 years from:
a. the time that the event that caused the loss or damage occurred in the company or installation, or ended; or
b. the date on which the genetically modified organisms were put into circulation.
2 The right to recourse is also limited in accordance with paragraph 1. The three-year
term begins as soon as damages have been paid in full and the person who shares
liability is known.
Art. 33 Simplification of proof
1 It is the responsibility of the person claiming damages to prove a causal connection.
2 If this proof cannot be provided with certainty or if production of proof cannot be
expected of the claimant, the court may satisfy itself on the balance of probabilities.
The court may also have the facts determined ex officio.
Art. 34 Guarantee
The Federal Council may, to protect the injured party:
a. require the person subject to the notification or authorisation requirement to
provide a guarantee for their liability by taking out insurance or in some other way;
b. set the scope and duration of this guarantee or leave this to the authority to
decide on a case-by-case basis;
c. require those providing a guarantee for the liability to notify the enforcement
authority of the existence, suspension or cessation of the guarantee;
