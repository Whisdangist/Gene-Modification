 	Section 42


Part 4—Commonwealth/State arrangements

42	Operation of State laws
This Act is not intended to exclude the operation of any law of a State, to the extent that the law of the State is capable of operating concurrently with this Act.

43	Conferral of functions on Commonwealth officers and bodies
(1)	A corresponding State law may confer functions, powers and duties on the following:
(a)	the NHMRC Licensing Committee;
(b)	a Commonwealth authority;
(c)	an officer of the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority.
(2)	If a function, power or duty is conferred on a person or body under subsection (1), the person or body may perform the function or duty or exercise the power, as the case requires.
(3)	Subsection (1) does not authorise the conferral of a function or power, or the imposition of a duty, by a corresponding State law to the extent to which:
(a)	the conferral or imposition, or the authorisation, would contravene any constitutional doctrines restricting the duties that may be imposed on a Commonwealth body, officer or authority; or
(b)	the authorisation would otherwise exceed the legislative power of the Commonwealth.
(4)	This Act is not intended to exclude or limit the operation of a corresponding State law that confers any functions or powers, or imposes any duties, on the NHMRC Licensing Committee, a Commonwealth officer or a Commonwealth authority to the extent to which that law:
 


 Section 44	

(a)	is consistent with subsections (1) and (2); and
(b)	is capable of operating concurrently with this Act.

44	When duty imposed
(1)	This section applies if a corresponding State law purports to impose a duty on the following:
(a)	the NHMRC Licensing Committee;
(b)	a Commonwealth authority;
(c)	an officer of the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority.
(2)	The duty is taken not to be imposed by this Act (or any other law of the Commonwealth) to the extent to which:
(a)	imposing the duty is within the legislative powers of the State concerned; and
(b)	imposing the duty by the corresponding State law is consistent with the constitutional doctrines restricting the duties that may be imposed on a Commonwealth body, officer or authority.
Note:	If this subsection applies, the duty will be taken to be imposed by force of the corresponding State law (the Commonwealth having consented under section 43 to the imposition of the duty by the corresponding State law).
(3)	If, to ensure the validity of the purported imposition of the duty, it is necessary that the duty be imposed by a law of the Commonwealth (rather than by force of the corresponding State law), the duty is taken to be imposed by this Act to the extent necessary to ensure that validity.
(4)	If, because of subsection (3), this Act is taken to impose the duty, it is the intention of the Parliament to rely on all powers available to it under the Constitution to support the imposition of the duty by this Act.
(5)	The duty is taken to be imposed by this Act in accordance with subsection (3) only to the extent to which imposing the duty:
 


 	Section 45

(a)	is within the legislative power of the Commonwealth; and
(b)	is consistent with the constitutional doctrines restricting the duties that may be imposed on a Commonwealth body, officer or authority.
(6)	To avoid doubt, neither this Act (nor any other law of the Commonwealth) imposes a duty on the NHMRC Licensing Committee, a Commonwealth officer or a Commonwealth authority to the extent to which imposing such a duty would:
(a)	contravene any constitutional doctrine restricting the duties that may be imposed on a Commonwealth body, officer or authority; or
(b)	otherwise exceed the legislative power of the Commonwealth.
(7)	Subsections (1) to (6) do not limit section 43.

45	Review of certain decisions
(1)	Application may be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of a reviewable State decision.
(2)	A decision made by the NHMRC Licensing Committee in the performance of a function or the exercise of a power conferred by a corresponding State law is a reviewable State decision for the purposes of this section if:
(a)	the law under which the decision was made provides for review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal; and
(b)	the decision is declared by the regulations to be a reviewable State decision for the purposes of this section.
(3)	For the purposes of this section, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 has effect as if a corresponding State law were an enactment.
