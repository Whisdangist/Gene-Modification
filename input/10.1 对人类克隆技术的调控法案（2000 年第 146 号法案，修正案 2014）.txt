Act on Regulation of Human Cloning Techniques (Act No. 146 of
2000)
Article 1 (Purpose)
The purpose of this Act is, in light of the risk that certain techniques including the
Cloning Techniques (hereinafter referred to as the “Cloning Techniques, etc.”) among
the techniques for manipulating Embryos or Germ Cells of a human or an Animal
could, depending on the way they are applied, create an individual with the same
gene structure as a certain individual (hereinafter referred to as a “Human Clone
Individual”) or an individual which cannot be clearly classified as a human or an
Animal (hereinafter referred to as an “Hybrid Individual”), or artificially create other
similar individuals, and have a serious influence on the preservation of human
dignity, safety for human life and body, and maintenance of public order (hereinafter
referred to as the “Preservation of Human Dignity, etc.”), to prevent creation of
Human Clone Individuals and Hybrid Individuals and to regulate artificial creation
of individuals similar to them by means of prohibiting transfer of Embryos produced
by the Cloning Techniques or Specified Fusion/Aggregation Techniques among
Cloning Techniques, etc. into a human or Animal uterus, regulating production,
receipt by assignment and import of Embryos created by Cloning Techniques, etc.,
and taking other measures for securing appropriate handling of such Embryos,
thereby ensuring the development of science and technology in harmony with society
and citizens lives.
