SECTION I. SCOPE OF THE NIH GUIDELINES
Section I-A. Purpose
The purpose of the NIH Guidelines is to specify the practices for constructing and handling: (i) recombinant
nucleic acid molecules, (ii) synthetic nucleic acid molecules, including those that are chemically or otherwise
modified but can base pair with naturally occurring nucleic acid molecules, and (iii) cells, organisms, and viruses
containing such molecules.
Section I-A-1. Any nucleic acid molecule experiment, which according to the NIH Guidelines requires approval
by NIH, must be submitted to NIH or to another Federal agency that has jurisdiction for review and approval.
Once approvals, or other applicable clearances, have been obtained from a Federal agency other than NIH
(whether the experiment is referred to that agency by NIH or sent directly there by the submitter), the
experiment may proceed without the necessity for NIH review or approval. (See exception in Section I-A-1-a
regarding requirement for human gene transfer protocol registration.)
Section I-A-1-a. For experiments involving the deliberate transfer of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid
molecules, or DNA or RNA derived from recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules, into human research
participants (human gene transfer), no research participant shall be enrolled (see definition of enrollment in
Section I-E-7) until the NIH protocol registration process has been completed (see Appendix M-I-B, Selection of
Individual Protocols for Public RAC Review and Discussion); Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) approval
(from the clinical trial site) has been obtained; Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval has been obtained; and
all applicable regulatory authorization(s) have been obtained.
For a clinical trial site that is added after the completion of the NIH protocol registration process, no research
participant shall be enrolled (see definition of enrollment in Section I-E-7) at the clinical trial site until IBC
approval and IRB approval from that site have been obtained. Within 30 days of enrollment (see definition of
enrollment in Section I-E-7) at a clinical trial site, the following documentation shall be submitted to NIH
OSP: (1) Institutional Biosafety Committee approval (from the clinical trial site); (2) Institutional Review Board
approval; (3) Institutional Review Board-approved informed consent document(s); and (4) NIH grant number(s) if
applicable.
Section I-B. Definition of Recombinant and Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules
In the context of the NIH Guidelines, recombinant and synthetic nucleic acids are defined as:
(i) molecules that a) are constructed by joining nucleic acid molecules and b) that can replicate in a
living cell, i.e., recombinant nucleic acids;
(ii) nucleic acid molecules that are chemically or by other means synthesized or amplified, including
those that are chemically or otherwise modified but can base pair with naturally occurring nucleic
acid molecules, i.e., synthetic nucleic acids, or
(iii) molecules that result from the replication of those described in (i) or (ii) above.

SECTION II. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
Section II-A. Risk Assessment
Section II-A-1. Risk Groups
Risk assessment is ultimately a subjective process. The investigator must make an initial risk assessment
based on the Risk Group (RG) of an agent (see Appendix B, Classification of Human Etiologic Agents on the
Basis of Hazard). Agents are classified into four Risk Groups (RGs) according to their relative pathogenicity for
healthy adult humans by the following criteria: (1) Risk Group 1 (RG1) agents are not associated with disease
in healthy adult humans. (2) Risk Group 2 (RG2) agents are associated with human disease which is rarely
serious and for which preventive or therapeutic interventions are often available. (3) Risk Group 3 (RG3) agents
are associated with serious or lethal human disease for which preventive or therapeutic interventions may be
available. (4) Risk Group 4 (RG4) agents are likely to cause serious or lethal human disease for which
preventive or therapeutic interventions are not usually available.
Section II-A-2. Criteria for Risk Groups
Classification of agents in Appendix B, Classification of Human Etiologic Agents on the Basis of Hazard, is
based on the potential effect of a biological agent on a healthy human adult and does not account for instances
in which an individual may have increased susceptibility to such agents, e.g., preexisting diseases, medications,
compromised immunity, pregnancy or breast feeding (which may increase exposure of infants to some agents).
Personnel may need periodic medical surveillance to ascertain fitness to perform certain activities; they may
also need to be offered prophylactic vaccines and boosters (see Section IV-B-1-f, Responsibilities of the
Institution, General Information).
Section II-A-3. Comprehensive Risk Assessment
In deciding on the appropriate containment for an experiment, the first step is to assess the risk of the agent
itself. Appendix B, Classification of Human Etiologic Agents on the Basis of Hazard, classifies agents into Risk
Groups based on an assessment of their ability to cause disease in humans and the available treatments for
such disease. Once the Risk Group of the agent is identified, this should be followed by a thorough
consideration of how the agent is to be manipulated. Factors to be considered in determining the level of
containment include agent factors such as: virulence, pathogenicity, infectious dose, environmental stability,
route of spread, communicability, operations, quantity, availability of vaccine or treatment, and gene product
effects such as toxicity, physiological activity, and allergenicity. Any strain that is known to be more hazardous
than the parent (wild-type) strain should be considered for handling at a higher containment level. Certain
attenuated strains or strains that have been demonstrated to have irreversibly lost known virulence factors may
qualify for a reduction of the containment level compared to the Risk Group assigned to the parent strain (see
Section V-B, Footnotes and References of Sections I-IV).
While the starting point for the risk assessment is based on the identification of the Risk Group of the parent
agent, as technology moves forward, it may be possible to develop an organism containing genetic sequences
from multiple sources such that the parent agent may not be obvious. In such cases, the risk assessment
should include at least two levels of analysis. The first involves a consideration of the Risk Groups of the
source(s) of the sequences and the second involves an assessment of the functions that may be encoded by
these sequences (e.g., virulence or transmissibility). It may be prudent to first consider the highest Risk Group
classification of all agents that are the source of sequences included in the construct. Other factors to be
considered include the percentage of the genome contributed by each parent agent and the predicted function
or intended purpose of each contributing sequence. The initial assumption should be that all sequences will
function as they did in the original host context.
The Principal Investigator and Institutional Biosafety Committee must also be cognizant that the combination of
certain sequences in a new biological context may result in an organism whose risk profile could be higher than
that of the contributing organisms or sequences. The synergistic function of these sequences may be one of the
key attributes to consider in deciding whether a higher containment level is warranted, at least until further
assessments can be carried out. A new biosafety risk may occur with an organism formed through combination 
Page 13 - NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (April 2016)
of sequences from a number of organisms or due to the synergistic effect of combining transgenes that results
in a new phenotype.
A final assessment of risk based on these considerations is then used to set the appropriate containment
conditions for the experiment (see Section II-B, Containment). The appropriate containment level may be
equivalent to the Risk Group classification of the agent or it may be raised or lowered as a result of the above
considerations. The Institutional Biosafety Committee must approve the risk assessment and the biosafety
containment level for recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid experiments described in Sections III-A, Experiments
that Require Institutional Biosafety Committee Approval, RAC Review, and NIH Director Approval Before
Initiation; III-B, Experiments that Require NIH OSP and Institutional Biosafety Committee Approval Before
Initiation; III-C, Experiments that Require Institutional Biosafety Committee and Institutional Review Board
Approvals and NIH OSP Registration Before Initiation; III-D, Experiments that Require Institutional Biosafety
Committee Approval Before Initiation.
Careful consideration should be given to the types of manipulation planned for some higher Risk Group agents.
For example, the RG2 dengue viruses may be cultured under the Biosafety Level (BL) 2 containment (see
Section II-B); however, when such agents are used for animal inoculation or transmission studies, a higher
containment level is recommended. Similarly, RG3 agents such as Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis and
yellow fever viruses should be handled at a higher containment level for animal inoculation and transmission
experiments.
Individuals working with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) or other bloodborne
pathogens should consult the applicable Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation, 29
CFR 1910.1030, and OSHA publication 3127 (1996 revised). BL2 containment is recommended for activities
involving all blood-contaminated clinical specimens, body fluids, and tissues from all humans, or from HIV- or
HBV-infected or inoculated laboratory animals. Activities such as the production of research-laboratory scale
quantities of HIV or other bloodborne pathogens, manipulating concentrated virus preparations, or conducting
procedures that may produce droplets or aerosols, are performed in a BL2 facility using the additional practices
and containment equipment recommended for BL3. Activities involving industrial scale volumes or preparations
of concentrated HIV are conducted in a BL3 facility, or BL3 Large Scale if appropriate, using BL3 practices and
containment equipment.
Exotic plant pathogens and animal pathogens of domestic livestock and poultry are restricted and may require
special laboratory design, operation and containment features not addressed in Biosafety in Microbiological and
Biomedical Laboratories (see Section V-C, Footnotes and References of Sections I through IV). For information
regarding the importation, possession, or use of these agents see Sections V-G and V-H, Footnotes and
References of Sections I through IV.
Section II-B. Containment
Effective biological safety programs have been operative in a variety of laboratories for many years.
Considerable information already exists about the design of physical containment facilities and selection of
laboratory procedures applicable to organisms carrying additional recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid
molecules (see Section V-B, Footnotes and References of Sections I-IV). The existing programs rely upon
mechanisms that can be divided into two categories: (i) a set of standard practices that are generally used in
microbiological laboratories; and (ii) special procedures, equipment, and laboratory installations that provide
physical barriers that are applied in varying degrees according to the estimated biohazard. Four biosafety levels
are described in Appendix G, Physical Containment. These biosafety levels consist of combinations of
laboratory practices and techniques, safety equipment, and laboratory facilities appropriate for the operations
performed and are based on the potential hazards imposed by the agents used and for the laboratory function
and activity. Biosafety Level 4 provides the most stringent containment conditions, Biosafety Level 1 the least
stringent.
Experiments involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules lend themselves to a third containment
mechanism, namely, the application of highly specific biological barriers. Natural barriers exist that limit either:
(i) the infectivity of a vector or vehicle (plasmid or virus) for specific hosts, or (ii) its dissemination and survival in
the environment. Vectors, which provide the means for recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule and/or
host cell replication, can be genetically designed to decrease, by many orders of magnitude, the probability of
dissemination of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule outside the laboratory (see Appendix I,
Biological Containment).
Page 14 - NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (April 2016)
Since these three means of containment are complementary, different levels of containment can be established
that apply various combinations of the physical and biological barriers along with a constant use of standard
practices. Categories of containment are considered separately in order that such combinations can be
conveniently expressed in the NIH Guidelines.
Physical containment conditions within laboratories, described in Appendix G, Physical Containment, may not
always be appropriate for all organisms because of their physical size, the number of organisms needed for an
experiment, or the particular growth requirements of the organism. Likewise, biological containment for
microorganisms described in Appendix I, Biological Containment, may not be appropriate for all organisms,
particularly higher eukaryotic organisms. However, significant information exists about the design of research
facilities and experimental procedures that are applicable to organisms containing additional recombinant or
synthetic nucleic acid molecules that are either integrated into the genome or into microorganisms associated
with the higher organism as a symbiont, pathogen, or other relationship. This information describes facilities for
physical containment of organisms used in non-traditional laboratory settings and special practices for limiting or
excluding the unwanted establishment, transfer of genetic information, and dissemination of organisms beyond
the intended location, based on both physical and biological containment principles. Research conducted in
accordance with these conditions effectively confines the organism.
For research involving plants, four biosafety levels (BL1-P through BL4-P) are described in Appendix P,
Physical and Biological Containment for Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecule Research Involving
Plants. BL1-P is designed to provide a moderate level of containment for experiments for which there is
convincing biological evidence that precludes the possibility of survival, transfer, or dissemination of
recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules into the environment, or in which there is no recognizable and
predictable risk to the environment in the event of accidental release. BL2-P is designed to provide a greater
level of containment for experiments involving plants and certain associated organisms in which there is a
recognized possibility of survival, transmission, or dissemination of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid
molecule containing organisms, but the consequence of such an inadvertent release has a predictably minimal
biological impact. BL3-P and BL4-P describe additional containment conditions for research with plants and
certain pathogens and other organisms that require special containment because of their recognized potential
for significant detrimental impact on managed or natural ecosystems. BL1-P relies upon accepted scientific
practices for conducting research in most ordinary greenhouse or growth chamber facilities and incorporates
accepted procedures for good pest control and cultural practices. BL1-P facilities and procedures provide a
modified and protected environment for the propagation of plants and microorganisms associated with the
plants and a degree of containment that adequately controls the potential for release of biologically viable
plants, plant parts, and microorganisms associated with them. BL2-P and BL3-P rely upon accepted scientific
practices for conducting research in greenhouses with organisms infecting or infesting plants in a manner that
minimizes or prevents inadvertent contamination of plants within or surrounding the greenhouse. BL4-P
describes facilities and practices known to provide containment of certain exotic plant pathogens.
For research involving animals, which are of a size or have growth requirements that preclude the use of
conventional primary containment systems used for small laboratory animals, four biosafety levels (BL1-N
through BL4-N) are described in Appendix Q, Physical and Biological Containment for Recombinant or Synthetic
Nucleic Acid Molecule Research Involving Animals. BL1-N describes containment for animals that have been
modified by stable introduction of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules, or DNA derived therefrom,
into the germ-line (transgenic animals) and experiments involving viable recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid
molecule-modified microorganisms and is designed to eliminate the possibility of sexual transmission of the
modified genome or transmission of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule-derived viruses known to be
transmitted from animal parent to offspring only by sexual reproduction. Procedures, practices, and facilities
follow classical methods of avoiding genetic exchange between animals. BL2-N describes containment which is
used for transgenic animals associated with recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule-derived organisms
and is designed to eliminate the possibility of vertical or horizontal transmission. Procedures, practices, and
facilities follow classical methods of avoiding genetic exchange between animals or controlling arthropod
transmission. BL3-N and BL4-N describe higher levels of containment for research with certain transgenic
animals involving agents which pose recognized hazard.
In constructing the NIH Guidelines, it was necessary to define boundary conditions for the different levels of
physical and biological containment and for the classes of experiments to which they apply. These definitions
do not take into account all existing and anticipated information on special procedures that will allow particular
experiments to be conducted under different conditions than indicated here without affecting risk. Individual 
Page 15 - NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (April 2016)
investigators and Institutional Biosafety Committees are urged to devise simple and more effective containment
procedures and to submit recommended changes in the NIH Guidelines to permit the use of these procedures.
***********************************************************************************************************************
SECTION III. EXPERIMENTS COVERED BY THE NIH GUIDELINES
This section describes six categories of experiments involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules:
(i) those that require Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) approval, RAC review, and NIH Director approval
before initiation (see Section III-A), (ii) those that require NIH OSP and Institutional Biosafety Committee
approval before initiation (see Section III-B), (iii) those that require Institutional Biosafety Committee and
Institutional Review Board approvals and RAC review before research participant enrollment (see Section III-C),
(iv) those that require Institutional Biosafety Committee approval before initiation (see Section III-D), (v) those
that require Institutional Biosafety Committee notification simultaneous with initiation (see Section III-E), and (vi)
those that are exempt from the NIH Guidelines (see Section III-F).
Note: If an experiment falls into Sections III-A, III-B, or III-C and one of the other sections, the rules pertaining
to Sections III-A, III-B, or III-C shall be followed. If an experiment falls into Section III-F and into either Sections
III-D or III-E as well, the experiment is considered exempt from the NIH Guidelines.
Any change in containment level, which is different from those specified in the NIH Guidelines, may not be
initiated without the express approval of NIH OSP (see Section IV-C-1-b-(2) and its subsections, Minor Actions).
Section III-A. Experiments that Require Institutional Biosafety Committee Approval, RAC Review, and
NIH Director Approval Before Initiation (See Section IV-C-1-b-(1), Major Actions).
Section III-A-1. Major Actions under the NIH Guidelines
Experiments considered as Major Actions under the NIH Guidelines cannot be initiated without submission of
relevant information on the proposed experiment to the Office of Science Policy, National Institutes of Health,
preferably by e-mail to: NIHGuidelines@od.nih.gov, the publication of the proposal in the Federal Register for
15 days of comment, review by RAC, and specific approval by NIH. The containment conditions or stipulation
requirements for such experiments will be recommended by RAC and set by NIH at the time of approval. Such
experiments require Institutional Biosafety Committee approval before initiation. Specific experiments already
approved are included in Appendix D, Major Actions Taken under the NIH Guidelines, which may be obtained
from the Office of Science Policy, National Institutes of Health, preferably by submitting a request for this
information to: NIHGuidelines@od.nih.gov; additional contact information is also available here and on the
OSP website (www.osp.od.nih.gov).
Section III-A-1-a. The deliberate transfer of a drug resistance trait to microorganisms that are not known to
acquire the trait naturally (see Section V-B, Footnotes and References of Sections I-IV), if such acquisition could
compromise the ability to control disease agents in humans, veterinary medicine, or agriculture, will be reviewed
by the RAC.
Consideration should be given as to whether the drug resistance trait to be used in the experiment would render
that microorganism resistant to the primary drug available to and/or indicated for certain populations, for
example children or pregnant women.
At the request of an Institutional Biosafety Committee, NIH OSP will make a determination regarding whether a
specific experiment involving the deliberate transfer of a drug resistance trait falls under Section III-A-1-a and
therefore requires RAC review and NIH Director approval. An Institutional Biosafety Committee may also
consult with NIH OSP regarding experiments that do not meet the requirements of Section III-A-1-a but
nonetheless raise important public health issues. NIH OSP will consult, as needed, with one or more experts,
which may include the RAC.
Section III-B. Experiments That Require NIH OSP and Institutional Biosafety Committee Approval
Before Initiation
Experiments in this category cannot be initiated without submission of relevant information on the proposed 
Page 16 - NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (April 2016)
experiment to NIH OSP. The containment conditions for such experiments will be determined by NIH OSP in
consultation with ad hoc experts. Such experiments require Institutional Biosafety Committee approval before
initiation (see Section IV-B-2-b-(1), Institutional Biosafety Committee).
Section III-B-1. Experiments Involving the Cloning of Toxin Molecules with LD50 of Less than 100
Nanograms per Kilogram Body Weight
Deliberate formation of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules containing genes for the biosynthesis of
toxin molecules lethal for vertebrates at an LD50 of less than 100 nanograms per kilogram body weight (e.g.,
microbial toxins such as the botulinum toxins, tetanus toxin, diphtheria toxin, and Shigella dysenteriae
neurotoxin). Specific approval has been given for the cloning in Escherichia coli K-12 of DNA containing genes
coding for the biosynthesis of toxic molecules which are lethal to vertebrates at 100 nanograms to 100
micrograms per kilogram body weight. Specific experiments already approved under this section may be
obtained from the Office of Science Policy, National Institutes of Health, preferably by submitting a request for
this information to: NIHGuidelines@od.nih.gov; additional contact information is also available here and on the
OSP website (www.osp.od.nih.gov).
Section III-B-2. Experiments that have been Approved (under Section III-A-1-a) as Major Actions under
the NIH Guidelines
Upon receipt and review of an application from the investigator, NIH OSP may determine that a proposed
experiment is equivalent to an experiment that has previously been approved by the NIH Director as a Major
Action, including experiments approved prior to implementation of these changes. An experiment will only be
considered equivalent if, as determined by NIH OSP, there are no substantive differences and pertinent
information has not emerged since submission of the initial III-A-1-a experiment that would change the biosafety
and public health considerations for the proposed experiments. If such a determination is made by NIH OSP,
these experiments will not require review and approval under Section III-A.
Section III-C. Experiments that Require Institutional Biosafety Committee and Institutional
Review Board Approvals and RAC Review (if applicable) Before Research Participant Enrollment
Section III-C-1. Experiments Involving the Deliberate Transfer of Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid
Molecules, or DNA or RNA Derived from Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules, into One or
More Human Research Participants
Human gene transfer is the deliberate transfer into human research participants of either:
1. Recombinant nucleic acid molecules, or DNA or RNA derived from recombinant nucleic acid
molecules, or
2. Synthetic nucleic acid molecules, or DNA or RNA derived from synthetic nucleic acid molecules,
that meet any one of the following criteria:
a. Contain more than 100 nucleotides; or
b. Possess biological properties that enable integration into the genome (e.g., cis elements
involved in integration); or
c. Have the potential to replicate in a cell; or
d. Can be translated or transcribed.
No research participant shall be enrolled (see definition of enrollment in Section I-E-7) until the NIH protocol
registration process has been completed (see Appendix M-I-B, Selection of Individual Protocols for Public RAC
Review and Discussion).
In its evaluation of human gene transfer protocols, the NIH will make a determination, following a request from
one or more oversight bodies involved in the review at an initial site(s), whether a proposed human gene
transfer experiment meets the the requirements for selecting protocols for RAC review and discussion (See
Appendix M-I-B). The process of public RAC review and discussion is intended to foster the safe and ethical
conduct of human gene transfer experiments. Public review and discussion of a human gene transfer
experiment (and access to relevant information) also serves to inform the public about the technical aspects of
the proposal, the meaning and significance of the research, and any significant safety, social, and ethical
implications of the research.
Public RAC review and discussion of a human gene transfer experiment will be initiated in two exceptional 
Page 17 - NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (April 2016)
circumstances: (1) Following a request for public RAC review from one or more oversight bodies involved in the
review at an initial site(s), the NIH concurs that (a) the individual protocol would significantly benefit from RAC
review and (b) that the submission meets one or more of the following NIH RAC review criteria: i) the protocol
uses a new vector, genetic material, or delivery methodology that represents a first-in-human experience, thus
presenting an unknown risk; ii) the protocol relies on preclinical safety data that were obtained using a new
preclinical model system of unknown and unconfirmed value; or iii) the proposed vector, gene construct, or
method of delivery is associated with possible toxicities that are not widely known and that may render it difficult
for oversight and federal regulatory bodies to evaluate the protocol rigorously. However, if one or more
oversight bodies involved in the review at an initial site(s) requests public RAC review, but the NIH does not
concur that (a) the individual protocol would significantly benefit from RAC review and (b) that the submission
meets one or more of the RAC review criteria (listed in i, ii, or iii), then the NIH OSP will inform, within 10
working days, the requesting and other oversight bodies involved in the review at an initial site(s) that public
RAC review is not warranted. (2) The NIH Director, in consultation (if needed) with appropriate regulatory
authorities, determines that the submission: (a) meets one or more of the NIH RAC review criteria (listed in i, ii,
or iii) and that public RAC review and discussion would provide a clear and obvious benefit to the scientific
community or the public; or (b) raises significant scientific, societal, or ethical concerns.
For a clinical trial site that is added after the completion of the NIH protocol registration process, no research
participant shall be enrolled (see definition of enrollment in Section I-E-7) at the clinical trial site until IBC
approval and IRB approval from that site have been obtained. Within 30 days of enrollment (see definition of
enrollment in Section I-E-7) at a clinical trial site, the following documentation shall be submitted to NIH
OSP: (1) Institutional Biosafety Committee approval (from the clinical trial site); (2) Institutional Review Board
approval; (3) Institutional Review Board-approved informed consent document(s); and (4) NIH grant number(s) if
applicable.
In order to maintain public access to information regarding human gene transfer (including protocols that are not
publicly reviewed by the RAC), the NIH OSP will maintain the documentation described in Appendices M-I
through M-II. The information provided in response to Appendix M should not contain any confidential
commercial or financial information or trade secrets, enabling all aspects of RAC review to be open to the public.
Note: For specific directives concerning the use of retroviral vectors for gene delivery, consult Appendix B-V-1,
Murine Retroviral Vectors.
Section III-D. Experiments that Require Institutional Biosafety Committee Approval Before Initiation
Prior to the initiation of an experiment that falls into this category, the Principal Investigator must submit a
registration document to the Institutional Biosafety Committee which contains the following information: (i) the
source(s) of DNA; (ii) the nature of the inserted DNA sequences; (iii) the host(s) and vector(s) to be used; (iv) if
an attempt will be made to obtain expression of a foreign gene, and if so, indicate the protein that will be
produced; and (v) the containment conditions that will be implemented as specified in the NIH Guidelines. For
experiments in this category, the registration document shall be dated, signed by the Principal Investigator, and
filed with the Institutional Biosafety Committee. The Institutional Biosafety Committee shall review and approve
all experiments in this category prior to their initiation. Requests to decrease the level of containment specified
for experiments in this category will be considered by NIH (see Section IV-C-1-b-(2)-(c), Minor Actions).
Section III-D-1. Experiments Using Risk Group 2, Risk Group 3, Risk Group 4, or Restricted Agents as
Host-Vector Systems (See Section II-A, Risk Assessment)
Section III-D-1-a. Experiments involving the introduction of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules
into Risk Group 2 agents will usually be conducted at Biosafety Level (BL) 2 containment. Experiments with
such agents will usually be conducted with whole animals at BL2 or BL2-N (Animals) containment.
Section III-D-1-b. Experiments involving the introduction of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules
into Risk Group 3 agents will usually be conducted at BL3 containment. Experiments with such agents will
usually be conducted with whole animals at BL3 or BL3-N containment.
Section III-D-1-c. Experiments involving the introduction of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules
into Risk Group 4 agents shall be conducted at BL4 containment. Experiments with such agents shall be
conducted with whole animals at BL4 or BL4-N containment.
Page 18 - NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (April 2016)
Section III-D-1-d. Containment conditions for experiments involving the introduction of recombinant or synthetic
nucleic acid molecules into restricted agents shall be set on a case-by-case basis following NIH OSP review. A
U.S. Department of Agriculture - Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA/APHIS) permit is required
for work with plant or animal pathogens (see Section V-G and V-M, Footnotes and References of Sections I-IV).
Experiments with such agents shall be conducted with whole animals at BL4 or BL4-N containment.
Section III-D-2. Experiments in Which DNA From Risk Group 2, Risk Group 3, Risk Group 4, or
Restricted Agents is Cloned into Nonpathogenic Prokaryotic or Lower Eukaryotic Host-Vector Systems
Section III-D-2-a. Experiments in which DNA from Risk Group 2 or Risk Group 3 agents (see Section II-A, Risk
Assessment) is transferred into nonpathogenic prokaryotes or lower eukaryotes may be performed under BL2
containment. Experiments in which DNA from Risk Group 4 agents is transferred into nonpathogenic
prokaryotes or lower eukaryotes may be performed under BL2 containment after demonstration that only a
totally and irreversibly defective fraction of the agent's genome is present in a given recombinant. In the
absence of such a demonstration, BL4 containment shall be used. The Institutional Biosafety Committee may
approve the specific lowering of containment for particular experiments to BL1. Many experiments in this
category are exempt from the NIH Guidelines (see Section III-F, Exempt Experiments). Experiments involving
the formation of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules for certain genes coding for molecules toxic for
vertebrates require NIH OSP approval (see Section III-B-1, Experiments Involving the Cloning of Toxin
Molecules with LD50 of Less than 100 Nanograms Per Kilogram Body Weight) or shall be conducted under NIH
specified conditions as described in Appendix F, Containment Conditions for Cloning of Genes Coding for the
Biosynthesis of Molecules Toxic for Vertebrates.
Section III-D-2-b. Containment conditions for experiments in which DNA from restricted agents is transferred
into nonpathogenic prokaryotes or lower eukaryotes shall be determined by NIH OSP following a case-by-case
review (see Section V-L, Footnotes and References of Sections I-IV). A U.S. Department of Agriculture permit
is required for work with plant or animal pathogens (see Section V-G, Footnotes and References of Sections IIV).
Section III-D-3. Experiments Involving the Use of Infectious DNA or RNA Viruses or Defective DNA or
RNA Viruses in the Presence of Helper Virus in Tissue Culture Systems
Caution: Special care should be used in the evaluation of containment levels for experiments which are likely
to either enhance the pathogenicity (e.g., insertion of a host oncogene) or to extend the host range (e.g.,
introduction of novel control elements) of viral vectors under conditions that permit a productive infection. In
such cases, serious consideration should be given to increasing physical containment by at least one level.
Note: Recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules or nucleic acid molecules derived therefrom, which
contain less than two-thirds of the genome of any eukaryotic virus (all viruses from a single Family (see Section
V-J, Footnotes and References of Sections I-IV) being considered identical (see Section V-K, Footnotes and
References of Sections I-IV), are considered defective and may be used in the absence of helper under the
conditions specified in Section III-E-1, Experiments Involving the Formation of Recombinant or Synthetic
Molecules Containing No More than Two-Thirds of the Genome of any Eukaryotic Virus.
Section III-D-3-a. Experiments involving the use of infectious or defective Risk Group 2 viruses (see Appendix
B-II, Risk Group 2 Agents) in the presence of helper virus may be conducted at BL2.
Section III-D-3-b. Experiments involving the use of infectious or defective Risk Group 3 viruses (see Appendix
B-III-D, Risk Group 3 (RG3) - Viruses and Prions) in the presence of helper virus may be conducted at BL3.
Section III-D-3-c. Experiments involving the use of infectious or defective Risk Group 4 viruses (see Appendix
B-IV-D, Risk Group 4 (RG4) - Viral Agents) in the presence of helper virus may be conducted at BL4.
Section III-D-3-d. Experiments involving the use of infectious or defective restricted poxviruses (see Sections
V-A and V-L, Footnotes and References of Sections I-IV) in the presence of helper virus shall be determined on
a case-by-case basis following NIH OSP review. A U.S. Department of Agriculture permit is required for work
with plant or animal pathogens (see Section V-G, Footnotes and References of Sections I-IV).
Section III-D-3-e. Experiments involving the use of infectious or defective viruses in the presence of helper
virus which are not covered in Sections III-D-3-a through III-D-3-d may be conducted at BL1.
Page 19 - NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (April 2016)
Section III-D-4. Experiments Involving Whole Animals
This section covers experiments involving whole animals in which the animal's genome has been altered by
stable introduction of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules, or nucleic acids derived therefrom, into
the germ-line (transgenic animals) and experiments involving viable recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid
molecule-modified microorganisms tested on whole animals. For the latter, other than viruses which are only
vertically transmitted, the experiments may not be conducted at BL1-N containment. A minimum containment of
BL2 or BL2-N is required.
Caution - Special care should be used in the evaluation of containment conditions for some experiments with
transgenic animals. For example, such experiments might lead to the creation of novel mechanisms or
increased transmission of a recombinant pathogen or production of undesirable traits in the host animal. In
such cases, serious consideration should be given to increasing the containment conditions.
Section III-D-4-a. Recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules, or DNA or RNA molecules derived
therefrom, from any source except for greater than two-thirds of eukaryotic viral genome may be transferred to
any non-human vertebrate or any invertebrate organism and propagated under conditions of physical
containment comparable to BL1 or BL1-N and appropriate to the organism under study (see Section V-B,
Footnotes and References of Sections I-IV). Animals that contain sequences from viral vectors, which do not
lead to transmissible infection either directly or indirectly as a result of complementation or recombination in
animals, may be propagated under conditions of physical containment comparable to BL1 or BL1-N and
appropriate to the organism under study. Experiments involving the introduction of other sequences from
eukaryotic viral genomes into animals are covered under Section III-D-4-b, Experiments Involving Whole
Animals. For experiments involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule-modified Risk Groups 2, 3,
4, or restricted organisms, see Sections V-A, V-G, and V-L, Footnotes and References of Sections I-IV. It is
important that the investigator demonstrate that the fraction of the viral genome being utilized does not lead to
productive infection. A U.S. Department of Agriculture permit is required for work with plant or animal
pathogens (see Section V-G, Footnotes and References of Sections I-IV).
Section III-D-4-b. For experiments involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules, or DNA or RNA
derived therefrom, involving whole animals, including transgenic animals, and not covered by Section III-D-1,
Experiments Using Human or Animal Pathogens (Risk Group 2, Risk Group 3, Risk Group 4, or Restricted
Agents as Host-Vector Systems), or Section III-D-4-a, the appropriate containment shall be determined by the
Institutional Biosafety Committee.
Section III-D-4-c. Exceptions under Section III-D-4, Experiments Involving Whole Animals
Section III-D-4-c-(1). Experiments involving the generation of transgenic rodents that require BL1 containment
are described under Section III-E-3, Experiments Involving Transgenic Rodents.
Section III-D-4-c-(2). The purchase or transfer of transgenic rodents is exempt from the NIH Guidelines under
Section III-F, Exempt Experiments (see Appendix C-VII, The Purchase or Transfer of Transgenic Rodents).
Section III-D-5. Experiments Involving Whole Plants
Experiments to genetically engineer plants by recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule methods, to use
such plants for other experimental purposes (e.g., response to stress), to propagate such plants, or to use
plants together with microorganisms or insects containing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules, may
be conducted under the containment conditions described in Sections III-D-5-a through III-D-5-e. If experiments
involving whole plants are not described in Section III-D-5 and do not fall under Sections III-A, III-B, III-D or III-F,
they are included in Section III-E.
NOTE - For recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule experiments falling under Sections III-D-5-a through
III-D-5-d, physical containment requirements may be reduced to the next lower level by appropriate biological
containment practices, such as conducting experiments on a virus with an obligate insect vector in the absence
of that vector or using a genetically attenuated strain.
Page 20 - NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (April 2016)
Section III-D-5-a. BL3-P (Plants) or BL2-P + biological containment is recommended for experiments involving
most exotic (see Section V-M, Footnotes and References of Sections I-IV) infectious agents with recognized
potential for serious detrimental impact on managed or natural ecosystems when recombinant or synthetic
nucleic acid molecule techniques are associated with whole plants.
Section III-D-5-b. BL3-P or BL2-P + biological containment is recommended for experiments involving plants
containing cloned genomes of readily transmissible exotic (see Section V-M, Footnotes and References of
Sections I-IV) infectious agents with recognized potential for serious detrimental effects on managed or natural
ecosystems in which there exists the possibility of reconstituting the complete and functional genome of the
infectious agent by genomic complementation in planta.
Section III-D-5-c. BL4-P containment is recommended for experiments with a small number of readily
transmissible exotic (see Section V-M, Footnotes and References of Sections I-IV) infectious agents, such as
the soybean rust fungus (Phakospora pachyrhizi) and maize streak or other viruses in the presence of their
specific arthropod vectors, that have the potential of being serious pathogens of major U.S. crops.
Section III-D-5-d. BL3-P containment is recommended for experiments involving sequences encoding potent
vertebrate toxins introduced into plants or associated organisms. Recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid
molecules containing genes for the biosynthesis of toxin molecules lethal for vertebrates at an LD50 of <100
nanograms per kilogram body weight fall under Section III-B-1, Experiments Involving the Cloning of Toxin
Molecules with LD50 of Less than 100 Nanograms Per Kilogram Body Weight, and require NIH OSP and
Institutional Biosafety Committee approval before initiation.
Section III-D-5-e. BL3-P or BL2-P + biological containment is recommended for experiments with microbial
pathogens of insects or small animals associated with plants if the recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid
molecule-modified organism has a recognized potential for serious detrimental impact on managed or natural
ecosystems.
Section III-D-6. Experiments Involving More than 10 Liters of Culture
The appropriate containment will be decided by the Institutional Biosafety Committee. Where appropriate,
Appendix K, Physical Containment for Large Scale Uses of Organisms Containing Recombinant or Synthetic
Recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid Molecules, shall be used. Appendix K describes containment conditions
Good Large Scale Practice through BL3-Large Scale.
Section III-D-7. Experiments Involving Influenza Viruses
Experiments with influenza viruses generated by recombinant or synthetic methods (e.g., generation by reverse
genetics of chimeric viruses with reassorted segments, introduction of specific mutations) shall be conducted at
the biosafety level containment corresponding to the Risk Group of the virus that was the source of the majority
of segments in the recombinant or synthetic virus (e.g., experiments with viruses containing a majority of
segments from a RG3 virus shall be conducted at BL3). Experiments with influenza viruses containing genes or
segments from 1918-1919 H1N1 (1918 H1N1), human H2N2 (1957-1968) and highly pathogenic avian influenza
H5N1 strains within the Goose/Guangdong/96-like H5 lineage (HPAI H5N1), including, but not limited to,
strains of HPAI H5N1 virus that are transmissible among mammals by respiratory droplets, as demonstrated
in an appropriate animal model or clinically in humans (hereinafter referred to as mammalian-transmissible
HPAI H5N1 virus), shall be conducted at BL3 enhanced containment (see Appendix G-II-C-5, Biosafety Level 3
Enhanced for Research Involving Risk Group 3 Influenza Viruses) unless indicated below.
Section III-D-7-a. Human H2N2 (1957-1968). Experiments with influenza viruses containing the H2
hemagglutinin (HA) segment shall be conducted at BL3 enhanced (see Appendix G-II-C-5, Biosafety Level 3
Enhanced for Research Involving Risk Group 3 Influenza Viruses). Experiments with the H2 HA gene in coldadapted, live attenuated vaccine strains (e.g., A/Ann Arbor/6/60 H2N2) may be conducted at BL2 containment
provided segments with mutations conferring temperature sensitivity and attenuation are not altered in the
recombinant or synthetic virus. Experiments with Risk Group 2 influenza viruses containing genes from human
H2N2 other than the HA gene can be worked on at BL2.
Page 21 - NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (April 2016)
Section III-D-7-b. Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N1 strains within the Goose/Guangdong/96-like
H5 lineage (HPAI H5N1). Experiments involving influenza viruses containing a majority of genes and/or
segments from a HPAI H5N1 influenza virus shall be conducted at BL3 enhanced containment, (see Appendix
G-II-C-5, Biosafety Level 3 Enhanced for Research Involving Risk Group 3 Influenza Viruses). Experiments
involving influenza viruses containing a minority of genes and/or segments from a HPAI H5N1 influenza virus
shall be conducted at BL3 enhanced unless a risk assessment performed by the IBC determines that they can
be conducted safely at biosafety level 2 and after they have been excluded pursuant to 9 CFR 121.3(e). NIH
OSP is available to IBCs to provide consultation with the RAC and influenza virus experts when risk
assessments are being made to determine the appropriate biocontainment for experiments with influenza
viruses containing a minority of gene/segments from HPAI H5N1. Such experiments may be performed at BL3
enhanced containment or containment may be lowered to biosafety level 2, the level of containment for most
research with other influenza viruses. (USDA/APHIS regulations and decisions on lowering containment also
apply.) In deciding to lower containment, the IBC should consider whether, in at least two animal models (e.g.,
ferret, mouse, Syrian golden hamster, cotton rat, non-human primates), there is evidence that the resulting
influenza virus shows reduced replication and virulence compared to the parental RG3 virus at relevant doses.
This should be determined by measuring biological indices appropriate for the specific animal model (e.g.,
severe weight loss, elevated temperature, mortality or neurological symptoms).
Section III-D-7-c. 1918 H1N1. Experiments involving influenza viruses containing any gene or segment from
1918 H1N1 shall be conducted at BL3 enhanced containment (see Appendix G-II-C-5, Biosafety Level 3
Enhanced for Research Involving Risk Group 3 Influenza Viruses).
Section III-D-7-d. Antiviral Susceptibility and Containment. The availability of antiviral drugs as preventive
and therapeutic measures is an important safeguard for experiments with 1918 H1N1, HPAI H5N1, and human
H2N2 (1957-1968). If an influenza virus containing genes from one of these viruses is resistant to both classes
of current antiviral agents, adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors, higher containment may be required
based on the risk assessment considering transmissibility to humans, virulence, pandemic potential, alternative
antiviral agents if available, etc.
Experiments with 1918 H1N1, human H2N2 (1957-1968) or HPAI H5N1 that are designed to create resistance
to neuraminidase inhibitors or other effective antiviral agents (including investigational antiviral agents being
developed for influenza) would be subject to Section III-A-1 (Major Actions) and require RAC review and NIH
Director approval. As per Section I-A-1 of the NIH Guidelines, if the agent is a Select Agent, the NIH will defer
to the appropriate Federal agency (HHS or USDA Select Agent Divisions) on such experiments.
Section III-E. Experiments that Require Institutional Biosafety Committee Notice Simultaneous with
Initiation
Experiments not included in Sections III-A, III-B, III-C, III-D, III-F, and their subsections are considered in
Section III-E. All such experiments may be conducted at BL1 containment. For experiments in this category, a
registration document (see Section III-D, Experiments that Require Institutional Biosafety Committee Approval
Before Initiation) shall be dated and signed by the investigator and filed with the local Institutional Biosafety
Committee at the time the experiment is initiated. The Institutional Biosafety Committee reviews and approves
all such proposals, but Institutional Biosafety Committee review and approval prior to initiation of the experiment
is not required (see Section IV-A, Policy). For example, experiments in which all components derived from nonpathogenic prokaryotes and non-pathogenic lower eukaryotes fall under Section III-E and may be conducted at
BL1 containment.
Page 22 - NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (April 2016)
Section III-E-1. Experiments Involving the Formation of Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid
Molecules Containing No More than Two-Thirds of the Genome of any Eukaryotic Virus
Recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules containing no more than two-thirds of the genome of any
eukaryotic virus (all viruses from a single Family being considered identical [see Section V-J, Footnotes and
References of Sections I-IV]) may be propagated and maintained in cells in tissue culture using BL1
containment. For such experiments, it must be demonstrated that the cells lack helper virus for the specific
Families of defective viruses being used. If helper virus is present, procedures specified under Section III-D-3,
Experiments Involving the Use of Infectious Animal or Plant DNA or RNA Viruses or Defective Animal or Plant
DNA or RNA Viruses in the Presence of Helper Virus in Tissue Culture Systems, should be used. The DNA
may contain fragments of the genome of viruses from more than one Family but each fragment shall be less
than two-thirds of a genome.
Section III-E-2. Experiments Involving Whole Plants
This section covers experiments involving nucleic acid molecule-modified whole plants, and/or experiments
involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule-modified organisms associated with whole plants,
except those that fall under Section III-A, III-B, III-D, or III-F. It should be emphasized that knowledge of the
organisms and judgment based on accepted scientific practices should be used in all cases in selecting the
appropriate level of containment. For example, if the genetic modification has the objective of increasing
pathogenicity or converting a non-pathogenic organism into a pathogen, then a higher level of containment may
be appropriate depending on the organism, its mode of dissemination, and its target organisms. By contrast, a
lower level of containment may be appropriate for small animals associated with many types of recombinant or
synthetic nucleic acid molecule-modified plants.
Section III-E-2-a. BL1-P is recommended for all experiments with recombinant or synthetic recombinant or
synthetic nucleic acid molecule-containing plants and plant-associated microorganisms not covered in Section
III-E-2-b or other sections of the NIH Guidelines. Examples of such experiments are those involving
recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule-modified plants that are not noxious weeds or that cannot
interbreed with noxious weeds in the immediate geographic area, and experiments involving whole plants and
recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule-modified non-exotic (see Section V-M, Footnotes and
References of Sections I-IV) microorganisms that have no recognized potential for rapid and widespread
dissemination or for serious detrimental impact on managed or natural ecosystems (e.g., Rhizobium spp. and
Agrobacterium spp.).
Section III-E-2-b. BL2-P or BL1-P + biological containment is recommended for the following experiments:
Section III-E-2-b-(1). Plants modified by recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules that are noxious
weeds or can interbreed with noxious weeds in the immediate geographic area.
Section III-E-2-b-(2). Plants in which the introduced DNA represents the complete genome of a non-exotic
infectious agent (see Section V-M, Footnotes and References of Sections I-IV).
Section III-E-2-b-(3). Plants associated with recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule-modified nonexotic microorganisms that have a recognized potential for serious detrimental impact on managed or natural
ecosystems (see Section V-M, Footnotes and References of Sections I-IV).
Section III-E-2-b-(4). Plants associated with recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule-modified exotic
microorganisms that have no recognized potential for serious detrimental impact on managed or natural
ecosystems (see Section V-M, Footnotes and References of Sections I-IV).
Section III-E-2-b-(5). Experiments with recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule-modified arthropods or
small animals associated with plants, or with arthropods or small animals with recombinant or synthetic nucleic
acid molecule-modified microorganisms associated with them if the recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid
molecule-modified microorganisms have no recognized potential for serious detrimental impact on managed or
natural ecosystems (see Section V-M, Footnotes and References of Sections I-IV).
Page 23 - NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (April 2016)
Section III-E-3. Experiments Involving Transgenic Rodents
This section covers experiments involving the generation of rodents in which the animal's genome has been
altered by stable introduction of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules, or nucleic acids derived
therefrom, into the germ-line (transgenic rodents). Only experiments that require BL1 containment are covered
under this section; experiments that require BL2, BL3, or BL4 containment are covered under Section III-D-4,
Experiments Involving Whole Animals.
Section III-E-3-a. Experiments involving the breeding of certain BL1 transgenic rodents are exempt under
Section III-F, Exempt Experiments (See Appendix C-VIII, Generation of BL1 Transgenic Rodents via Breeding).
Section III-F. Exempt Experiments
The following recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules are exempt from the NIH Guidelines and
registration with the Institutional Biosafety Committee is not required; however, other federal and state
standards of biosafety may still apply to such research (for example, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC)/NIH publication Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories).
Section III-F-1. Those synthetic nucleic acids that: (1) can neither replicate nor generate nucleic acids that can
replicate in any living cell (e.g., oligonucleotides or other synthetic nucleic acids that do not contain an origin of
replication or contain elements known to interact with either DNA or RNA polymerase), and (2) are not designed
to integrate into DNA, and (3) do not produce a toxin that is lethal for vertebrates at an LD50 of less than 100
nanograms per kilogram body weight. If a synthetic nucleic acid is deliberately transferred into one or more
human research participants and meets the criteria of Section III-C, it is not exempt under this Section.
Section III-F-2. Those that are not in organisms, cells, or viruses and that have not been modified or
manipulated (e.g., encapsulated into synthetic or natural vehicles) to render them capable of penetrating cellular
membranes.
Section III-F-3. Those that consist solely of the exact recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid sequence from a

SECTION IV. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
Section IV-A. Policy
The safe conduct of experiments involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules depends on the
individual conducting such activities. The NIH Guidelines cannot anticipate every possible situation. Motivation
and good judgment are the key essentials to protection of health and the environment. The NIH Guidelines are
intended to assist the institution, Institutional Biosafety Committee, Biological Safety Officer, and the Principal
Investigator in determining safeguards that should be implemented. The NIH Guidelines will never be complete
or final since all conceivable experiments involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules cannot be
foreseen. The utilization of new genetic manipulation techniques may enable work previously conducted using
recombinant means to be accomplished faster, more efficiently, or at larger scale. These techniques have not
yet yielded organisms that present safety concerns that fall outside the current risk assessment framework used
for recombinant nucleic acid research. Nonetheless, an appropriate risk assessment of experiments involving
these techniques must be conducted taking into account the way these approaches may alter the risk
assessment. As new techniques develop, the NIH Guidelines should be periodically reviewed to determine
whether and how such research should be explicitly addressed.
It is the responsibility of the institution and those associated with it to adhere to the intent of the NIH Guidelines
as well as to their specifics. Therefore, each institution (and the Institutional Biosafety Committee acting on its
behalf) is responsible for ensuring that all research with recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules
conducted at or sponsored by that institution is conducted in compliance with the NIH Guidelines. The following
roles and responsibilities constitute an administrative framework in which safety is an essential and integral part
of research involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules. Further clarifications and interpretations
of roles and responsibilities will be issued by NIH as necessary.
Section IV-B. Responsibilities of the Institution
Section IV-B-1. General Information
Each institution conducting or sponsoring recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule research which is
covered by the NIH Guidelines is responsible for ensuring that the research is conducted in full conformity with
the provisions of the NIH Guidelines. In order to fulfill this responsibility, the institution shall:
Section IV-B-1-a. Establish and implement policies that provide for the safe conduct of recombinant or
synthetic nucleic acid molecule research and that ensure compliance with the NIH Guidelines. As part of its
general responsibilities for implementing the NIH Guidelines, the institution may establish additional procedures,
as deemed necessary, to govern the institution and its components in the discharge of its responsibilities under
the NIH Guidelines. Such procedures may include: (i) statements formulated by the institution for the general
implementation of the NIH Guidelines, and (ii) any additional precautionary steps the institution deems
appropriate.
Section IV-B-1-b. Establish an Institutional Biosafety Committee that meets the requirements set forth in
Section IV-B-2-a and carries out the functions detailed in Section IV-B-2-b.
Section IV-B-1-c. Appoint a Biological Safety Officer (who is also a member of the Institutional Biosafety
Committee) if the institution: (i) conducts recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule research at Biosafety
Level (BL) 3 or BL4, or (ii) engages in large-scale (greater than 10 liters) research. The Biological Safety Officer
carries out the duties specified in Section IV-B-3.
Section IV-B-1-d. Appoint at least one individual with expertise in plant, plant pathogen, or plant pest
containment principles (who is a member of the Institutional Biosafety Committee) if the institution conducts
recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule research that requires Institutional Biosafety Committee approval
in accordance with Appendix P, Physical and Biological Containment for Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid
Molecule Research Involving Plants.
Section IV-B-1-e. Appoint at least one individual with expertise in animal containment principles (who is a
member of the Institutional Biosafety Committee) if the institution conducts recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid
molecule research that requires Institutional Biosafety Committee approval in accordance with Appendix Q, 
Page 25 - NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (April 2016)
Physical and Biological Containment for Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecule Research Involving
Animals.
Section IV-B-1-f. Ensure that when the institution participates in or sponsors recombinant or synthetic nucleic
acid molecule research involving human subjects: (i) the Institutional Biosafety Committee has adequate
expertise and training (using ad hoc consultants as deemed necessary), (ii) all aspects of Appendix M have
been appropriately addressed by the Principal Investigator; and (iii) no research participant shall be enrolled
(see definition of enrollment in Section I-E-7) in a human gene transfer experiment until the NIH protocol
registration process has been completed (see Appendix M-I-B, Selection of Individual Protocols for Public RAC
Review and Discussion), Institutional Biosafety Committee approval has been obtained, Institutional Review
Board approval has been obtained, and all applicable regulatory authorizations have been obtained.
Institutional Biosafety Committee approval must be obtained from the clinical trial site.
Section IV-B-1-g. Assist and ensure compliance with the NIH Guidelines by Principal Investigators conducting
research at the institution as specified in Section IV-B-7.
Section IV-B-1-h. Ensure appropriate training for the Institutional Biosafety Committee Chair and members,
Biological Safety Officer and other containment experts (when applicable), Principal Investigators, and
laboratory staff regarding laboratory safety and implementation of the NIH Guidelines. The Institutional
Biosafety Committee Chair is responsible for ensuring that Institutional Biosafety Committee members are
appropriately trained. The Principal Investigator is responsible for ensuring that laboratory staff are
appropriately trained. The institution is responsible for ensuring that the Principal Investigator has sufficient
training; however, this responsibility may be delegated to the Institutional Biosafety Committee.
Section IV-B-1-i. Determine the necessity for health surveillance of personnel involved in connection with
individual recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule projects; and if appropriate, conduct a health
surveillance program for such projects. The institution shall establish and maintain a health surveillance
program for personnel engaged in large-scale research or production activities involving viable organisms
containing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules which require BL3 containment at the laboratory
scale. The institution shall establish and maintain a health surveillance program for personnel engaged in
animal research involving viable recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule-containing microorganisms that
require BL3 or greater containment in the laboratory. The Laboratory Safety Monograph discusses various
components of such a program (e.g., records of agents handled, active investigation of relevant illnesses, and
the maintenance of serial serum samples for monitoring serologic changes that may result from the employees'
work experience). Certain medical conditions may place a laboratory worker at increased risk in any endeavor
where infectious agents are handled. Examples cited in the Laboratory Safety Monograph include
gastrointestinal disorders and treatment with steroids, immunosuppressive drugs, or antibiotics. Workers with
such disorders or treatment should be evaluated to determine whether they should be engaged in research with
potentially hazardous organisms during their treatment or illness. Copies of the Laboratory Safety Monograph
are available from the Office of Science Policy, National Institutes of Health, preferably by submitting a request
for this information to: NIHGuidelines@od.nih.gov; additional contact information is also available here and on
the OSP website (www.osp.od.nih.gov).

Section IV-D. Voluntary Compliance
Section IV-D-1. Basic Policy - Voluntary Compliance
Individuals, corporations, and institutions not otherwise covered by the NIH Guidelines are encouraged to follow
the standards and procedures set forth in Sections I through IV. In order to simplify discussion, references
hereafter to “institutions” are intended to encompass corporations and individuals who have no organizational
affiliation. For purposes of complying with the NIH Guidelines, an individual intending to carry out research
involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules is encouraged to affiliate with an institution that has an
Institutional Biosafety Committee approved under the NIH Guidelines.
Since commercial organizations have special concerns, such as protection of proprietary data, some
modifications and explanations of the procedures are provided in Sections IV-D-2 through IV-D-5-b, Voluntary
Compliance, in order to address these concerns.
Page 35 - NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (April 2016)
Section IV-D-2. Institutional Biosafety Committee Approval - Voluntary Compliance
It should be emphasized that employment of an Institutional Biosafety Committee member solely for purposes of
membership on the Institutional Biosafety Committee does not itself make the member an institutionally affiliated
member. Except for the unaffiliated members, a member of an Institutional Biosafety Committee for an
institution not otherwise covered by the NIH Guidelines may participate in the review and approval of a project in
which the member has a direct financial interest so long as the member has not been, and does not expect to
be, engaged in the project. Section IV-B-2-a-(4), Institutional Biosafety Committee, is modified to that extent for
purposes of these institutions.
Section IV-D-3. Certification of Host-Vector Systems - Voluntary Compliance
A host-vector system may be proposed for certification by the NIH Director in accordance with the procedures
set forth in Appendix I-II, Certification of Host-Vector Systems. In order to ensure protection for proprietary data,
any public notice regarding a host-vector system which is designated by the institution as proprietary under
Section IV-D, Voluntary Compliance, will be issued only after consultation with the institution as to the content of
the notice.
Section IV-D-4. Requests for Exemptions and Approvals - Voluntary Compliance
Requests for exemptions or other approvals as required by the NIH Guidelines should be submitted based on
the procedures set forth in Sections I through IV. In order to ensure protection for proprietary data, any public
notice regarding a request for an exemption or other approval which is designated by the institution as
proprietary under Section IV-D-5-a, Voluntary Compliance, will be issued only after consultation with the
institution as to the content of the notice.
Section IV-D-5. Protection of Proprietary Data - Voluntary Compliance
Section IV-D-5-a. General
In general, the Freedom of Information Act requires Federal agencies to make their records available to the
public upon request. However, this requirement does not apply to, among other things, “trade secrets and
commercial or financial information that is obtained from a person and that is privileged or confidential.” Under
18 U.S.C. 1905, it is a criminal offense for an officer or employee of the U.S. or any Federal department or
agency to publish, divulge, disclose, or make known “in any manner or to any extent not authorized by law any
information coming to him in the course of his employment or official duties or by reason of any examination or
investigation made by, or return, report or record made to or filed with, such department or agency or officer or
employee thereof, which information concerns or relates to the trade secrets, (or) processes...of any person,
firm, partnership, corporation, or association.” This provision applies to all employees of the Federal
Government, including special Government employees. Members of RAC are “special Government
employees.”
In submitting to NIH for purposes of voluntary compliance with the NIH Guidelines, an institution may designate
those items of information which the institution believes constitute trade secrets, privileged, confidential,
commercial, or financial information. If NIH receives a request under the Freedom of Information Act for
information so designated, NIH will promptly contact the institution to secure its views as to whether the
information (or some portion) should be released. If NIH decides to release this information (or some portion) in
response to a Freedom of Information request or otherwise, the institution will be advised and the actual release
will be delayed in accordance with 45 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 5.65(d) and (e).
Section IV-D-5-b. Pre-submission Review
Any institution not otherwise covered by the NIH Guidelines, which is considering submission of data or
information voluntarily to NIH, may request pre-submission review of the records involved to determine if NIH
will make all or part of the records available upon request under the Freedom of Information Act.
A request for pre-submission review should be submitted to NIH OSP along with the records involved to the Office
of Science Policy, National Institutes of Health, preferably by e-mail to: HGTprotocols@mail.nih.gov; additional
contact information is also available here and on the OSP website (www.osp.od.nih.gov). These records 
Page 36 - NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (April 2016)
shall be clearly marked as being the property of the institution on loan to NIH solely for the purpose of making a
determination under the Freedom of Information Act. NIH OSP will seek a determination from the responsible
official under DHHS regulations (45 CFR Part 5) as to whether the records involved, (or some portion) will be
made available to members of the public under the Freedom of Information Act. Pending such a determination,
the records will be kept separate from NIH OSP files, will be considered records of the institution and not NIH
OSP, and will not be received as part of NIH OSP files. No copies will be made of such records.
NIH OSP will inform the institution of the NIH Freedom of Information Officer's determination and follow the
institution's instructions as to whether some or all of the records involved are to be returned to the institution or
to become a part of NIH OSP files. If the institution instructs NIH OSP to return the records, no copies or
summaries of the records will be made or retained by DHHS, NIH, or OSP. The NIH Freedom of Information
Officer's determination will represent that official's judgment at the time of the determination as to whether the
records involved (or some portion) would be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act if at
the time of the determination the records were in NIH OSP files and a request was received for such files under
the Freedom of Information Act.

APPENDIX A. EXEMPTIONS UNDER SECTION III-F-6--SUBLISTS OF NATURAL EXCHANGERS
Certain specified recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules that consist entirely of DNA segments from
different species that exchange DNA by known physiological processes, though one or more of the segments
may be a synthetic equivalent are exempt from these NIH Guidelines (see Section III-F-6, Exempt Experiments).
Institutional Biosafety Committee registration is not required for these exempt experiments. A list of such
exchangers will be prepared and periodically revised by the NIH Director with advice from the RAC after
appropriate notice and opportunity for public comment (see Section IV-C-1-b-(1)-(c), NIH Director--Specific
Responsibilities). For a list of natural exchangers that are exempt from the NIH Guidelines, see Appendices A-I
through A-VI, Exemptions under Section III-F-6 Sublists of Natural Exchangers. Section III-F-6, Exempt
Experiments, describes recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules that are: (1) composed entirely of DNA
segments from one or more of the organisms within a sublist, and (2) to be propagated in any of the organisms
within a sublist (see Classification of Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology; 8th edition, R. E.
Buchanan and N. E. Gibbons, editors, Williams and Wilkins Company; Baltimore, Maryland 1984). Although
these experiments are exempt, it is recommended that they be performed at the appropriate biosafety level for
the host or recombinant/synthetic organism (see Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories, 5th
edition, 2007, U.S. DHHS, Public Health Service, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia,

APPENDIX B. CLASSIFICATION OF HUMAN ETIOLOGIC AGENTS ON THE BASIS OF HAZARD
This appendix includes those biological agents known to infect humans as well as selected animal agents that
may pose theoretical risks if inoculated into humans. Included are lists of representative genera and species
known to be pathogenic; mutated, recombined, and non-pathogenic species and strains are not considered.
Non-infectious life cycle stages of parasites are excluded.
This appendix reflects the current state of knowledge and should be considered a resource document. Included
are the more commonly encountered agents and is not meant to be all-inclusive. Information on agent risk
assessment may be found in the Agent Summary Statements of the CDC/NIH publication, Biosafety in
Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (see Sections V-C, V-D, V-E, and V-F, Footnotes and References
of Sections I through IV. Further guidance on agents not listed in Appendix B may be obtained through:

A special committee of the American Society for Microbiology will conduct an annual review of this appendix and
its recommendation for changes will be presented to the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee as proposed
amendments to the NIH Guidelines. 
Page 39 - NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (April 2016)
Appendix B - Table 1. Basis for the Classification of Biohazardous Agents by Risk Group (RG)
Risk Group 1 (RG1) Agents that are not associated with disease in healthy adult humans
Risk Group 2 (RG2) Agents that are associated with human disease which is rarely serious and for
which preventive or therapeutic interventions are often available
Risk Group 3 (RG3) Agents that are associated with serious or lethal human disease for which
preventive or therapeutic interventions may be available (high individual risk but
low community risk)
Risk Group 4 (RG4) Agents that are likely to cause serious or lethal human disease for which
preventive or therapeutic interventions are not usually available (high individual
risk and high community risk)
Appendix B-I. Risk Group 1 (RG1) Agents
RG1 agents are not associated with disease in healthy adult humans. Examples of RG1 agents include
asporogenic Bacillus subtilis or Bacillus licheniformis (see Appendix C-IV-A, Bacillus subtilis or Bacillus
licheniformis Host-Vector Systems, Exceptions); adeno- associated virus (AAV – all serotypes); and
recombinant or synthetic AAV constructs, in which the transgene does not encode either a potentially
tumorigenic gene product or a toxin molecule and are produced in the absence of a helper virus. A strain of
Escherichia coli (see Appendix C-II-A, Escherichia coli K-12 Host Vector Systems, Exceptions) is an RG1 agent
if it (1) does not possess a complete lipopolysaccharide (i.e., lacks the O antigen); and (2) does not carry any
active virulence factor (e.g., toxins) or colonization factors and does not carry any genes encoding these factors.
Those agents not listed in Risk Groups (RGs) 2, 3 and 4 are not automatically or implicitly classified in RG1; a
risk assessment must be conducted based on the known and potential properties of the agents and their
relationship to agents that are listed.
Appendix B-II. Risk Group 2 (RG2) Agents
RG2 agents are associated with human disease which is rarely serious and for which preventive or therapeutic
interventions are often available.

APPENDIX C. EXEMPTIONS UNDER SECTION III-F-8
Section III-F-8 states that exempt from these NIH Guidelines are "those that do not present a significant risk to
health or the environment (see Section IV-C-1-b-(1)-(c), NIH Director--Specific Responsibilities), as determined
by the NIH Director, with the advice of the RAC, and following appropriate notice and opportunity for public
comment. See Appendix C, Exemptions under Sections III-F-8, for other classes of experiments which are
exempt from the NIH Guidelines." The following classes of experiments are exempt under Section III-F-8:
Appendix C-I. Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules in Tissue Culture
Recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules containing less than one-half of any eukaryotic viral genome
(all viruses from a single family being considered identical -- see Appendix C-IX-E, Footnotes and References of

Guidelines with the exceptions listed in Appendix C-I-A. 
Page 46 - NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (April 2016)
Appendix C-I-A. Exceptions
The following categories are not exempt from the NIH Guidelines: (i) experiments described in Section III-B
which require NIH OSP and Institutional Biosafety Committee approval before initiation, (ii) experiments
involving DNA from Risk Groups 3, 4, or restricted organisms (see Appendix B, Classification of Human
Etiologic Agents on the Basis of Hazard, and Sections V-G and V-L, Footnotes and References of Sections I
through IV) or cells known to be infected with these agents, (iii) experiments involving the deliberate introduction
of genes coding for the biosynthesis of molecules that are toxic for vertebrates (see Appendix F, Containment
Conditions for Cloning of Genes Coding for the Biosynthesis of Molecules Toxic for Vertebrates), and (iv) whole
plants regenerated from plant cells and tissue cultures are covered by the exemption provided they remain
axenic cultures even though they differentiate into embryonic tissue and regenerate into plantlets.
Appendix C-II. Escherichia coli K-12 Host-Vector Systems
Experiments which use Escherichia coli K-12 host-vector systems, with the exception of those experiments
listed in Appendix C-II-A, are exempt from the NIH Guidelines provided that: (i) the Escherichia coli host does
not contain conjugation proficient plasmids or generalized transducing phages; or (ii) lambda or lambdoid or Ff

APPENDIX D. MAJOR ACTIONS TAKEN UNDER THE NIH GUIDELINES
As noted in the subsections of Section IV-C-1-b-(1), the Director, NIH, may take certain actions with regard to
the NIH Guidelines after the issues have been considered by the RAC. Some of the actions taken to date
include the following:
Appendix D-1. Permission is granted to clone foot and mouth disease virus in the EK1 host-vector system
consisting of E. coli K-12 and the vector pBR322, all work to be done at the Plum Island Animal Disease Center.
Appendix D-2. Certain specified clones derived from segments of the foot and mouth disease virus may be

modified by recombinant DNA techniques under specified containment conditions.
Appendix D-6. Permission is granted to clone in E. coli K-12 under BL1 physical containment conditions
subgenomic segments of rift valley fever virus subject to conditions which have been set forth by the RAC.
Appendix D-7. Attenuated laboratory strains of Salmonella typhimurium may be used under BL1 physical
containment conditions to screen for the Saccharomyces cerevisiae pseudouridine synthetase gene. The
plasmid YEp13 will be employed as the vector.
Page 50 - NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (April 2016)
Appendix D-8. Permission is granted to transfer certain clones of subgenomic segments of foot and mouth
disease virus from Plum Island Animal Disease Center to the laboratories of Molecular Genetics, Inc.,
Minnetonka, Minnesota, and to work with these clones under BL1 containment conditions. Approval is
contingent upon review of data on infectivity testing of the clones by a working group of the RAC.
Appendix D-9. Permission is granted to Dr. John Sanford of Cornell University to field test tomato and tobacco
plants transformed with bacterial (E.coli K-12) and yeast DNA using pollen as a vector.
Appendix D-10. Permission is granted to Drs. Steven Lindow and Nickolas Panopoulos of the University of
California, Berkeley, to release under specified conditions Pseudomonas syringae, pathovars (pv.) syringae,
and Erwinia herbicola carrying in vitro generated deletions of all or part of the genes involved in ice nucleation.
Appendix D-11. Agracetus of Middleton, Wisconsin, may field test under specified conditions disease resistant
tobacco plants prepared by recombinant DNA techniques.
Appendix D-12. Eli Lilly and Company of Indianapolis, Indiana, may conduct large-scale experiments and
production involving Cephalosporium acremonium strain LU4-79-6 under less than Biosafety Level 1 - Large
Scale (BL1-LS) conditions.
Appendix D-13. Drs. W. French Anderson, R. Michael Blaese, and Steven Rosenberg of the NIH, Bethesda,
Maryland, can conduct experiments in which a bacterial gene coding for neomycin phosphotransferase will be
inserted into a portion of the tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) of cancer patients using a retroviral vector, N2.
The marked TIL then will be combined with unmarked TIL, and reinfused into the patients. This experiment is
an addition to an ongoing adoptive immunotherapy protocol in which TIL are isolated from a patient's tumor,
grown in culture in the presence of interleukin-2, and reinfused into the patient. The marker gene will be used to
detect TIL at various time intervals following reinfusion.
Approval is based on the following four stipulations: (I) there will be no limitation of the number of patients in the
continuing trial; (ii) the patients selected will have a life expectancy of about 90 days; (iii) the patients give fully
informed consent to participate in the trial; and (iv) the investigators will provide additional data before inserting
a gene for therapeutic purposes. (Protocol #8810-001)
Appendix D-14. U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) may conduct certain
experiments involving products of a yellow fever virus originating from the 17-D yellow fever clone at the
Biosafety Level 3 containment level using HEPA filters and vaccination of laboratory personnel.
In addition, USAMRIID may conduct certain experiments involving vaccine studies of Venezuelan equine
encephalitis virus at the Biosafety Level 3 containment level using HEPA filters and vaccination of laboratory
personnel.
Appendix D-15. Drs. R. Michael Blaese and W. French Anderson of the NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, can conduct
experiments in which a gene coding for adenosine deaminase (ADA) will be inserted into T lymphocytes of
patients with severe combined immunodeficiency disease, using a retroviral vector, LASN. Following insertion
of the gene, these T lymphocytes will be reinfused into the patients. The patients will then be followed for
evidence of clinical improvement in the disease state, and measurement of multiple parameters of immune
function by laboratory testing.
Approval is based on the following two stipulations: (I) that intraperitoneal administration of transduced T
lymphocytes not be used before clearance by the Chair of the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee; and (ii)
that the number of research patients be limited to 10 at this time.
In addition to the conditions outlined in the initial approval, patients may be given a supplement of a CD-34+-
enriched peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) which have been placed in culture conditions that favor progenitor
cell growth. This enriched population of cells will be transduced with the retroviral vector, G1NaSvAd.
G1NaSvAd is similar to LASN, yet distinguishable by PCR. LASN has been used to transduce peripheral blood
T lymphocytes with the ADA gene. Lymphocytes and myeloid cells will be isolated from patients over time and
assayed for the presence of the LASN or G1NaSvAd vectors. The primary objectives of this protocol are to
transduce CD 34+ peripheral blood cells with the adenosine deaminase gene, administer these cells to patients,
and determine if such cells can differentiate into lymphoid and myeloid cells in vivo. There is a potential for
benefit to the patients in that these hematopoietic progenitor cells may survive longer, and divide to yield a
broader range of gene-corrected cells. (Protocol #9007-002)
Page 51 - NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (April 2016)
Appendix D-16. Dr. Steven A. Rosenberg of the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, can conduct
experiments on patients with advanced melanoma who have failed all effective therapy. These patients will be
treated with escalating doses of autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) transduced with a gene coding
for tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Escalating numbers of transduced TIL will be administered at three weekly
intervals along with the administration of interleukin-2 (IL-2). The objective is to evaluate the toxicity and
possible therapeutic efficacy of the administration of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) transduced with the
gene coding for TNF. (Protocol #9007-003)
Appendix D-17. Dr. Malcolm K. Brenner of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital of Memphis, Tennessee, can
conduct experiments on patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Using the LNL6 retroviral vector, the
autologous bone marrow cells will be transduced with the gene coding for neomycin resistance. The purpose of
this gene marking experiment is to determine whether the source of relapse after autologous bone marrow
transplantation for acute myelogenous leukemia is residual malignant cells in the harvested marrow or
reoccurrence of tumor in the patient. Determining the source of relapse should indicate whether or not purging
of the bone marrow is a necessary procedure. (Protocol #9102-004)
Appendix D-18. Dr. Malcolm K. Brenner of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital of Memphis, Tennessee, can
conduct experiments on pediatric patients with Stage D (disseminated) neuroblastoma who are being treated
with high-dose carboplatin and etoposide in either phase I/II or phase II trials. All the patients in these studies
will be subjected to bone marrow transplantation since it will allow them to be exposed to chemoradiation that
would be lethal were it not for the availability of stored autologous marrow for rescue. The bone marrow cells of
these patients will be transduced with the gene coding for neomycin resistance using the LNL6 vector. The
purpose of this gene marking study is to determine whether the source of relapse after autologous bone marrow
transplantation is residual malignant cells in the harvested marrow or residual disease in the patient. Secondly,
it is hoped to determine the contribution of marrow autographs to autologous reconstitution. (Protocol #9105-
005/9105-006)
Appendix D-19. Dr. Albert B. Deisseroth of the MD Anderson Cancer Center of Houston, Texas, can conduct
experiments on patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia who have been reinduced into a second chronic
phase or blast cells. The patients in these studies will receive autologous bone marrow transplantation. Using
the LNL6 vector, the bone marrow cells will be transduced with the gene coding for neomycin resistance. The
purpose of these marking studies is to determine if the origin of relapse arises from residual leukemic cells in the
patients or from viable leukemic cells remaining in the bone marrow used for autologous transplantation.
(Protocol #9105-007)
Appendix D-20. Drs. Fred D. Ledley and Savio L. C. Woo of Baylor College of Medicine of Houston, Texas,
can conduct experiments on pediatric patients with acute hepatic failure who are identified as candidates for
hepatocellular transplantation. Using the LNL6 vector, the hepatocytes will be transduced with the gene coding
for neomycin resistance. The purpose of using a genetic marker is to demonstrate the pattern of engraftment of
transplanted hepatocytes and to help determine the success or failure of engraftment. (Protocol #9105-008)
Appendix D-21. Dr. Steven A. Rosenberg of the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, can conduct
experiments on patients with advanced melanoma, renal cell cancer, and colon carcinoma who have failed all
effective therapy. In an attempt to increase these patients' immune responses to the tumor, the tumor necrosis
factor gene or the interleukin-2 gene will be introduced into a tumor cell line established from the patient. These
gene-modified autologous tumor cells will then be injected into the thigh of the patient. To further utilize the
immune system of the patient to fight the tumor, stimulated lymphocytes will be cultured from either the draining
regional lymph nodes or the injected tumor itself. The patients will be evaluated for antitumor effects
engendered by the injection of the gene modified tumor cells themselves as well as after the infusion of the
cultured lymphocytes. (Protocol #9110-010/9110-011)
Appendix D-22. Dr. James M. Wilson of the University of Michigan Medical Center of Ann Arbor, Michigan, can
conduct experiments on three patients with the homozygous form of familial hypercholesterolemia. Both
children and adults will be eligible for this therapy. In an attempt to correct the basic genetic defect in this
disease, the gene coding for the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor will be introduced into liver cells taken
from the patient. The gene-corrected hepatocytes will then be infused into the portal circulation of the patient
through an indwelling catheter. The patients will be evaluated for engraftment of the these treated hepatocytes
through a series of metabolic studies; three months after gene therapy, a liver biopsy will be taken and analyzed 
Page 52 - NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (April 2016)
for the presence of recombinant derived RNA and DNA to document the presence of the gene coding for the
normal LDL receptor. (Protocol #9110-012)
Appendix D-23. Dr. Michael T. Lotze of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania, can conduct experiments on 20 patients with metastatic melanoma who have failed conventional
therapy. A gene transfer experiment will be performed, transducing the patients' tumor infiltrating lymphocytes
(TILs) with the gene for neomycin resistance. Through the use of this gene marking technique, it is proposed to
determine how long TIL cells can be detected in vivo in the peripheral blood of the patients, and how the
administration of interleukin-2 and interleukin-4 affects localization and survival of TIL cells in tumor sites.
(Protocol #9105-009)
Appendix D-24. Dr. Gary J. Nabel of the University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, can
conduct gene therapy experiments on twelve patients with melanoma or adenocarcinoma. Patient population
will be limited to adults over the age of 18 and female patients must be postmenopausal or have undergone
tubal ligation or orchiectomy. The patient's immune response will be stimulated by the introduction of a gene
encoding for a Class I MHC protein, HLA-B7, in order to enhance tumor regression. DNA/liposome-mediated
transfection techniques will be used to directly transfer this foreign gene into tumor cells. HLA-B7 expression
will be confirmed in vivo, and the immune response stimulated by the expression of this antigen will be
characterized. These experiments will be analyzed for their efficacy in treating cancer. (Protocol #9202-013)
Appendix D-25. Kenneth Cornetta of Indiana University, Indianapolis, Indiana, can conduct gene transfer
experiments on up to 10 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and up to 10 patients with acute
lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). The patient population will be limited to persons between 18 and 65 years of age.
Using the LNL-6 vector, autologous bone marrow cells will be marked with the neomycin resistance gene. Gene
marked and untreated bone marrow cells will be reinfused at the time of bone marrow transplantation. Patients
will then be monitored for evidence of the neomycin resistance gene in peripheral blood and bone marrow cells
in order to determine whether relapse of their disease is a result of residual malignant cells remaining in the
harvested marrow or inadequate ablation of the tumor cells by chemotherapeutic agents. Determining the
source of relapse may indicate whether or not purging of the bone marrow is a necessary procedure for these
leukemia patients. Further studies will be performed in order to determine the percentage of leukemic cells that
contain the LNL-6 vector and the clonality of the marked cells. (Protocol #9202-014)
Appendix D-26. Dr. James S. Economou of the University of California, Los Angeles, can conduct gene
transfer experiments on 20 patients with metastatic melanoma and 20 patients with renal cell carcinoma. These
patients will be treated with various combinations of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and peripheral blood
leukocytes, including CD8 and CD4 subsets of both types of cells. These effector cell populations will be given
in combination with interleukin-2 (IL-2) in the melanoma patients and IL-2 plus alpha interferon in the renal cell
carcinoma patients. The effector cells will be transduced with the neomycin resistance gene using either the
LNL6 or G1N retroviral vectors. This "genetic marking" of the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and peripheral
blood lymphocytes is designed to answer questions about the trafficking of these cells, their localization to
tumors, and their in vivo life span. (Protocol #9202-015)
Appendix D-27. Drs. Philip Greenberg and Stanley R. Riddell of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center,
Seattle, Washington, may conduct gene transfer experiments on 15 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
seropositive patients (18-45 years old) undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma and 15 HIV-seropositive patients (18-50 years old) who do not have acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome (AIDS)-related lymphoma and who are not undergoing bone marrow transplantation to evaluate the
safety and efficacy of HIV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) therapy. CTL will be transduced with a
retroviral vector (HyTK) encoding a gene that is a fusion product of the hygromycin phosphotransferase gene
(HPH) and the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) gene. This vector will deliver both a marker
gene and an ablatable gene in these T cell clones in the event that patients develop side effects as a
consequence of CTL therapy. Data will be correlated over time, looking at multiple parameters of HIV disease
activity. The objectives of these studies include evaluating the safety and toxicity of CTL therapy, determining
the duration of in vivo survival of HIV-specific CTL clones, and determining if ganciclovir therapy can eradicate
genetically modified, adoptively transferred CTL cells. (Protocol #9202-017)
Appendix D-28. Dr. Malcolm Brenner of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, can
conduct gene therapy experiments on twelve patients with relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma who have
relapsed after receiving autologous bone marrow transplant. In an attempt to stimulate the patient's immune
response, the gene coding for Interleukin-2 (IL-2) will be used to transduce tumor cells, and these gene-modified 
Page 53 - NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (April 2016)
cells will be injected subcutaneously in a Phase 1 dose escalation trial. Patients will be evaluated for an antitumor response. (Protocol #9206-018)
Appendix D-29. Drs. Edward Oldfield, Kenneth Culver, Zvi Ram, and R. Michael Blaese of the National
Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, can conduct gene therapy experiments on ten patients with primary
malignant brain tumors and ten patients with lung cancer, breast cancer, malignant melanoma, or renal cell
carcinoma who have brain metastases. The patient population will be limited to adults over the age of 18.
Patients will be divided into two groups based on the surgical accessibility of their lesions. Both surgically
accessible and surgically inaccessible lesions will receive intra-tumoral injections of the retroviral Herpes
simplex thymidine kinase (HS-tk) vector-producer cell line, G1TkSvNa, using a guided stereotaxic approach.
Surgically accessible lesions will be excised seven days after stereotaxic injection, and the tumor bed will be
infiltrated with the HS-tk producer cells. The removed tumor will be evaluated for the efficiency of transduction.
Ganciclovir (GCV) will be administered beginning on the fifth postoperative day. In the case of surgically
inaccessible lesions, the patients will receive intravenous therapy with GCV seven days after receiving the intratumoral injections of the retroviral HS-tk vector-producer cells. (Protocol #9206-019)
Appendix D-30. Dr. Albert D. Deisseroth of MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, can conduct gene
transfer experiments on ten patients who have developed blast crisis or accelerated phase chronic
myelogenous leukemia (CML). The retroviral vectors G1N and LNL6 which code for neomycin resistance will be
used to transduce autologous peripheral blood and bone marrow cells that have been removed and stored at
the time of cytogenetic remission or re-induction of chronic phase in Philadelphia chromosome positive CML
patients. Following reinduction of the chronic phase of CML and preparative chemotherapy, patients will be
infused with the transduced autologous cells.
This protocol is designed to determine the cause of relapse of CML. If polyclonal CML neomycin marked blastic
cells appear at the time of relapse, their presence will indicate that relapse arises from the leukemic CML blast
cells present in the autologous cells infused following chemotherapy. If residual systemic disease contributes to
relapse, the neomycin resistance gene will not be detected in the CML leukemic blasts at the time of relapse.
This study will compare the relative contributions of the peripheral blood and bone marrow to generate
hematopoietic recovery after bone marrow transplantation and evaluate purging and selection of peripheral
blood or bone marrow as a source of stem cells for transplant. The percentage of neomycin resistant CML cells
which are leukemic will be determined by PCR analysis and detection of bcr-abl mRNA. (Protocol #9206-020)
Appendix D-31. Dr. Cynthia Dunbar of the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, can conduct gene
transfer experiments on up to 48 patients with multiple myeloma, breast cancer, or chronic myelogenous
leukemia. The retroviral vectors G1N and LNL6 will be used to transfer the neomycin resistance marker gene
into autologous bone marrow and peripheral blood stem cells in the presence of growth factors to examine
hematopoietic reconstitution after bone marrow transplantation. The efficiency of transduction of both short and
long term autologous bone marrow reconstituting cells will be examined.
Autologous bone marrow and CD34+ peripheral blood stem cells will be enriched prior to transduction.
Myeloma and CML patients will receive both autologous bone marrow and peripheral blood stem cell
transplantation. These separate populations will be marked with both the G1N and LNL6 retroviral vectors. If
short and long term marking experiments are successful, important information may be obtained regarding the
biology of autologous reconstitution, the feasibility of retroviral gene transfer into hematopoietic cells, and the
contribution of viable tumor cells within the autograft to disease relapse. (Protocol #9206-023/9206-024/9206-
025)
Appendix D-32. Dr. Bernd Gansbacher of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York,
can conduct gene therapy experiments on twelve patients over 18 years of age with metastatic melanoma who
are HLA-A2 positive and who have failed conventional therapy. This is a phase I study to examine whether
allogeneic HLA-A2 matched melanoma cells expressing recombinant human Interleukin-2 (IL-2) can be injected
subcutaneously and used to create a potent tumor specific immune response without producing toxicity. By
allowing the tumor cells to present the MHC Class I molecule as well as the secreted IL-2, a clonal expansion of
tumor specific effector cells is expected. These effector populations may access residual tumor at distant sites
via the systemic circulation. (Protocol #9206-021)
Page 54 - NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (April 2016)
Appendix D-33. Dr. Bernd Gansbacher of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York,
can conduct gene therapy experiments on twelve patients over 18 years of age with renal cell carcinoma who
are HLA-A2 positive and who have failed conventional therapy. This Phase I study will examine whether
allogeneic HLA-A2 matched renal cell carcinoma cells expressing recombinant human Interleukin-2 (IL-2) can
be injected subcutaneously and used to create a potent tumor specific immune response without producing
toxicity. By allowing the tumor cells to present the MHC Class I molecule as well as the secreted IL-2, a clonal
expansion of tumor specific effector cells is expected. These effector populations may access residual tumor at
distant sites via the systemic circulation. (Protocol #9206-022)
Appendix D-34. Dr. Michael T. Lotze, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, can conduct
experiments on twenty patients with metastatic, and/or unresectable, locally advanced melanoma, renal cell
carcinoma, breast cancer, or colon cancer who have failed standard therapy. Patients will receive multiple
subcutaneous injections of autologous tumor cells combined with an autologous fibroblast cell line that has been
transduced in vitro with the gene coding for Interleukin-4 (IL-4) to augment the in vivo antitumor effect. Patients
will be monitored for antitumor effect by PCR analysis and multiple biopsy of the injection site. (Protocol #9209-
033)
Appendix D-35. Dr. Friedrich G. Schuening, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington,
can conduct human gene transfer experiments on patients ≥ 18 years of age with breast cancer, Hodgkin's
disease, or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. A total of 10 patients per year will be enrolled in the studies over a period

Interleukin-3 (IL-3) or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) stimulated CD34(+) peripheral blood
repopulating cells (PBRC) that have been transduced with the gene coding for neomycin resistance (neoR) using
the retroviral vector, LN. Patients will be continuously monitored for neoR to determine the relative contribution
of autologous PBRCs to long-term hematopoietic reconstitution. Demonstration of long-term contribution of
autologous PBRC to hematopoiesis will enable the use of PBRC alone for autologous transplants and suggest
the use of PBRC as long-term carriers of therapeutically relevant genes. (Protocol #9209-027/9209-028)
Appendix D-36. Dr. Friedrich G. Schuening, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington,
can conduct human gene transfer experiments on patients ≥ 18 years of age with breast cancer, Hodgkin's
disease, or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. A total of 5 patients per year will be enrolled in the study over a period of
four years. Patients will undergo allogeneic bone marrow transplant with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor
(G-CSF) stimulated CD34(+) PBRC harvested from an identical twin that have been transduced with neoR using
the retroviral vector, LN. Patients will be continuously monitored for neoR to determine the relative contribution
of G-CSF stimulated allogeneic PBRCs to long-term bone marrow engraftment. Demonstration of long-term
contribution of allogeneic PBRC to hematopoiesis will enable the use of PBRC alone for allogeneic transplants
and suggest the use of PBRC as long-term carriers of therapeutically relevant genes. (Protocol #9209-029)
Appendix D-37. Dr. Malcolm K. Brenner of St. Jude Children's Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, and Dr. Bonnie
J. Mills of Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Santa Ana, California, can conduct a multicenter uncontrolled human
gene transfer experiment on 12 patients ≤ 21 years of age with Stage D Neuroblastoma in first or second
marrow remission. Autologous bone marrow cells will be separated into two fractions, purged and unpurged.
Each fraction will be transduced with the neoR gene by either LNL6 or G1Na. Patients will be monitored by the
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of neoR. The protocol is designed to evaluate the safety and
efficacy of the Neuroblastoma Bone Marrow Purging System following high dose chemotherapy. (Protocol

progressive, or residual disease who have no other therapy available to prolong survival. Patients will be
injected intraperitoneally with the irradiated PA-1 ovarian carcinoma cell line which has been transduced with
the herpes simplex thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) gene. The patients will then receive ganciclovir therapy.
Previous, data indicates that HSV-TK+ tumor cells exhibit a killing effect on HSV-TK- cells when exposed to
ganciclovir therapy. Patients will be evaluated for safety and side effects of this treatment. (Protocol #9206-016)

Appendix D-40. Dr. Michael J. Welsh, Howard Hughes Medical Institute Research Laboratories, University of
Iowa College of Medicine, Iowa City, Iowa, may conduct experiments on 3 cystic fibrosis (CF) patients ≥ 18
years of age with mild to moderate disease. This Phase I study will determine the: (1) in vivo safety and
efficacy of the administration of the replication-deficient type 2 adenovirus vector, Ad2/CFTR-1, to the nasal
epithelium; (2) efficacy in correcting the CF chloride transport defect in vivo; and (3) effect of adenovirus vector
dosage on safety and efficacy. (Protocol #9212-036)
Appendix D-41. Dr. Ronald G. Crystal, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, may conduct
experiments on 10 cystic fibrosis (CF) patients ≥ 21 years of age. Patients will receive an initial administration
of the replication-deficient type 5 adenovirus vector, AdCFTR, to their left nares. If no toxicity is observed from
intranasal administration, patients will receive a single administration of AdCFTR to the respiratory epithelium of
their left large bronchi. Five groups of patients (2 patients per group) will be studied based on increased dosage
administration of AdCFTR. This study will determine the: (1) in vivo safety and efficacy of the administration of
AdCFTR into the respiratory epithelium; (2) efficacy of the correction of the biologic abnormalities of CF in the
respiratory epithelium; (3) duration of the biologic correction; (4) efficacy of the correction of the abnormal
electrical potential difference of the airway epithelial sheet; (5) clinical parameters relevant to the disease
process; and (6) if humoral immunity develops against AdCFTR sufficient to prevent repeat administration.

metastases who have failed standard therapy for their disease. Patient eligibility will be limited to those patients
who have measurable residual tumor immediately following the post-operative procedure as demonstrated by
imaging studies. The number of patients treated will be equally divided between the Iowa Methodist Medical
Center and the University of Iowa. If a positive response is observed in any of the first 15 patients, the
investigators may submit a request to treat an additional 15 patients.
Following surgical debulking, patients will receive a maximum of 3 intralesional injections of the G1TkSvNa
vector- producing cell line (VPC) to induce regression of residual tumor cells by ganciclovir (GCV) therapy.
Patients who demonstrate stable disease for a minimum of 6 months following this treatment will be eligible for

Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, may conduct experiments of 35 patients ≤ 21 years of age who will be
recipients of mismatched-related or phenotypically similar unrelated donor marrow grafts for leukemia. In this
Phase I dose escalation study, spontaneous lymphoblastoid cell lines will be established that express the same
range of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) encoded proteins as the recipient. These EBV-specific cell lines will be
transduced with LNL6 or G1Na and readministered at the time of bone marrow transplant. This study will
determine: (1) survival and expansion of these EBV-specific cell lines in vivo, (2) the ability of these adoptively
transferred cells to confer protection against EBV infection, and (3) appropriate dosage and administration
schedules. (Protocol #9303-038)
Appendix D-45. Drs. Robert W. Wilmott and Jeffrey Whitsett, Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati,
Ohio, and Dr. Bruce Trapnell, Genetic Therapy, Inc., Gaithersburg, Maryland, may conduct experiments on 15
cystic fibrosis (CF) patients who have mild to moderate disease ≥ 21 years of age. The replication-deficient type
5 adenovirus vector, Av1CF2, will be administered to the nasal and lobar bronchial respiratory tract of patients.
This study will demonstrate the: (1) expression of normal cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
(CFTR) mRNA in vivo, (2) synthesis of CFTR protein, and (3) correction of epithelial cell cAMP dependent Clpermeability. The pharmacokinetics of CFTR expression and ability to re-infect the respiratory tract with AvCF2
will be determined. Systemic and local immunologic consequences of Av1CF2 infection, the time of viral
survival, and potential for recombination or complementation of the virus will be monitored. (Protocol #9303-041)

engraftment of CD34(+) hematopoietic stem cells transduced by a retroviral vector, G1MD, and expressing a
cDNA for the human multi-drug resistance-1 (MDR-1) gene following high dose chemotherapy, and whether the
transduced MDR-1 gene confers drug resistance to hematopoietic cells and functions as an in vivo dominant

results in severe T-cell immunodeficiency, an autosomal recessive inherited disease which is usually fatal in the
first decade of life. Autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes will be cultured in an artificial capillary cartridge in
the presence of anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody and interleukin-2 and transduced with the retroviral vector,
LPNSN-2, encoding human PNP. Subjects will undergo bimonthly intravenous administration of transduced T
cells for a maximum of 1 year. The objectives of the study are to determine: (1) the safety of intravenous
administration of transduced T cells in children with PNP deficiency, (2) the efficiency of PNP gene transfer and
duration of gene expression in vivo, and (3) the effect of PNP gene transfer on immune function. (Protocol

Appendix D-99. Drs. Nikhil C. Munshi and Bart Barlogie of the University of Arkansas School for Medical
Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas, may conduct gene transfer experiments on 21 subjects (>18 and <65 years of
age) with relapsed or persistent multiple myeloma who are undergoing T cell depleted allogeneic bone marrow
transplantation. Donor peripheral blood lymphocytes will be cultured in vitro with interleukin-2 and anti-CD3
monoclonal antibody. T cell depleted lymphocytes will be transduced with the retroviral construct,
G1Tk1SvNa.7, which encodes the Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) gene. The transduced cells
will be reinfused. In this dose escalation study, 3 subjects will undergo cell-mediated gene transfer per cohort
(maximum of 5 cohorts) until Grade III or IV Graft versus Host Disease (GVHD) is observed. A maximum of 6
additional patients may be entered at that maximum tolerated dose. The objectives of this study are to
determine the: (1) safety of transduced donor cell infusions, (2) effectiveness of donor cell infusions in
decreasing the effects of severe GVHD, (3) effectiveness of donor cell infusions in prolonging multiple myeloma
remission, and (4) effectiveness of ganciclovir in eliminating donor cells for the purpose of preventing the
depletion of erythrocytes. (Protocol #9506-107)
Appendix D-100. Dr. Wayne A. Marasco of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, may
conduct gene transfer experiments on 6 subjects (≥ 18 and ≤ 65 years of age) with human immunodeficiency
virus type-1 (HIV-1). Autologous lymphocytes from asymptomatic subjects will be transduced ex vivo with a
retroviral vector, LNCs105, encoding the sFv105 antibody specific for the HIV-1 envelope protein. An identical
aliquot will be simultaneously transduced with a control retroviral vector lacking the sFv105 cassette.
Transduced cells will be reinfused into patients and the differential survival of both populations of CD4+
lymphocytes compared. The objective of the study is to determine whether the intracellular expression of a
human single chain antibody against HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp160 that blocks gp160 processing and the
production of infectious virions can safely prolong the survival of CD4(+) lymphocytes in HIV-1-infected subjects.
(Protocol #9506-111)
Appendix D-101. Dr. Henry Dorkin of the New England Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, and Dr. Allen
Lapey of Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, propose to conduct
gene transfer experiments on 16 subjects (≥ 18 years of age). An E1/partial E4-deleted, replication-deficient,
type 2 adenovirus vector, AD2/CFTR-2, will be used to deliver the human cystic fibrosis transmembrane
conductance regulator (CFTR) gene by aerosol administration (nebulization) to the lung of CF patients. Aerosol
administration will be initiated only after initial safety data has been obtained from the lobar administration
protocol (#9409-091). This is a single administration dose-escalation study in which subjects will receive
between 8 x 106 and 2.5 x 1010 pfu. Subjects will be assessed for evidence of adverse, systemic, immune,
inflammatory, or respiratory effects in response to AD2/CFTR-2. Subjects will be monitored for virus shedding
and transgene expression. Health care workers present in the facility will be required to sign an Informed
Consent document regarding the possibility of virus transmission. (Protocol #9412-074)
Appendix D-102. Drs. Charles J. Link and Donald Moorman of the Human Gene Therapy Research Institute,
Des Moines, Iowa, may conduct gene transfer experiments on 24 female subjects (≥ 18 years of age) with
refractory or recurrent ovarian cancer. Subjects will undergo intraperitoneal delivery (via Tenkhoff catheter) of
the vector producing cells (VPC), PA317/LTKOSN.2. These VPC express the Herpes simplex virus thymidine
kinase (HSV-TK) gene which confers sensitivity to killing by the antiviral drug, ganciclovir (GCV). The
LTKOSN.2 retrovirus vector is based on the LXSN backbone. Two weeks following intraperitoneal delivery of
the VPC, subjects will receive 5 mg/kg intravenous GCV twice daily for 14 days. Subjects will receive between
1 x 105 and 1 x 108 VPC/kg in this dose escalation study. Subjects will be evaluated by X-ray and
peritoneoscopy of the abdomen for evidence of clinical response. The objectives of this study are to determine
the safety of intraperitoneal VPC administration. (Protocol #9503-100)
Appendix D-103. Dr. David T. Curiel of the University of Alabama, Birmingham, Alabama, may conduct gene
transfer experiment of 15 subjects (≥ 18 years of age) with metastatic colorectal cancer. Subjects will receive
intramuscular injection of the polynucleotide vaccine, pGT63, which is a plasmid DNA vector expressing
carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). The objectives of the study are to:
(1) characterize the immune response to CEA and HBsAg following a single intramuscular injection and
following 3 consecutive intramuscular injections, and (2) determine the safety of intramuscular injection of the
plasmid DNA vector at doses ranging between 0.1 to 1.0 milligrams (single dose) and 0.9 to 3.0 milligrams (total
multidose). (Protocol #9506-073)

Appendix D-104. Dr. Chester B. Whitley of the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, may conduct
gene transfer experiments on two adult subjects (18 years of age or older) with mild Hunter syndrome
(Mucopolysaccharidosis Type II). The autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes will be transduced ex vivo with
the retroviral vector, L2SN, encoding the human cDNA for iduronate-2-sulfatase (IDS). The transduced
lymphocytes will be reinfused into the patients on a monthly basis. The study will determine the frequency of
peripheral blood lymphocyte transduction and the half-life of the infused cells. Evaluation of patients will include
measurement of blood levels of IDS enzyme, assessment of metabolic correction by urinary glycosaminoglycan
levels, clinical response of the disease, and monitoring for potential toxicity. This Phase I study is to
demonstrate the safety of the L2SN-mediated gene therapy and to provide a preliminary evaluation of clinical
efficacy. (Protocol #9409-087)
Appendix D-105. Drs. James Economou, John Glaspy, and William McBride of the University of California, Los
Angeles, California, may conduct gene transfer experiments on 25 subjects (≥ 18 years of age) with metastatic
melanoma. The protocol is an open label, Phase I trial to evaluate the safety and immunological effects of
administering lethally irradiated allogeneic and autologous melanoma cells transduced with the retroviral vector,
IL-7/HyTK, which encodes the gene for human interleukin-7 (IL-7). Subjects will receive 1 x 107 irradiated
unmodified autologous tumor cells in combination with escalating doses of IL-7/HyTK transduced allogeneic
melanoma cells (M24 cell line). The number of M24 cells administered will be adjusted based on the level of IL7 expression. Subjects will receive 3 biweekly subcutaneous injections of M24 cells expressing 10, 100, or
1000 nanograms of IL-7/hour in vivo. A final cohort of 5 subjects will receive IL-7/HyTK transduced autologous
cells. Subjects will be monitored for antitumor activity by skin tests, biopsy analysis, tumor-specific antibody
activity, and cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursor evaluation. Non-immunologic parameters will also be monitored.
(Protocol #9503-101)
Appendix D-106. Dr. Jack A. Roth, MD Anderson Cancer Center, may conduct gene transfer experiments on
42 subjects (≥ 18 years of age) with refractory non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Subjects will receive direct
intratumoral injection of a replication-defective type 5 adenovirus vector, AD5CMV-p53, to deliver the normal
human p53 tumor suppressor gene. The E1 region of AD5CMV-p53 has been replaced with a p53 expression
cassette containing the human cytomegalovirus promoter (CMV). Subjects will be divided into 2 treatment
groups: (1) 21 subjects will receive Ad5CMV-p53 alone, and (2) 21 subjects will receive Ad5CMV-p53 in
combination with cisplatin. Following vector administration, subjects will be isolated for 96 hours during which
time, assays will be conducted to demonstrate the lack of shedding of adenovirus vector. The objectives of this
study are determine: (1) the maximum tolerated dose of AD5CMV-p53, (2) qualitative and quantitative toxicity
related to vector administration, and (3) biologic activity.
Prior to administration, adenovirus vector stocks will be screened for p53 mutants using the SAOS
osteosarcoma cell assay that was submitted by Dr. Roth on June 23, 1995. This biologic assay compares the
activity of a standard stock of Adp53 vector to the activity of newly produced stocks. The standard stock of
Adp53 will be defined as mediating cell death in 100% of SAOS cells (human osteosarcoma cell line with
homozygous p53 deletion) at an MOI of 50:1 (titer > 5 x 1010) on day 5 of culture. The sensitivity of the assay
for detecting inactive (presumed mutant) Adp53 vector will be determined by adding increasing amounts of
Adluc (control adenovirus vector containing the luciferase gene) to the Adp53 stock to determine the percentage
of inactive vector required to decrease growth inhibition of SAOS cells mediated by Adp53. The test lot of
Adp53 will be tested for its ability to inhibit SAOS in a 5 day assay. Significant loss of inhibitory activity
compared with the standard would indicate an unacceptable level of inactive (presumed mutant) vector.
(Protocol #9406-079)
Appendix D-107A. Dr. Gary Clayman. M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, may conduct gene
transfer experiments on 21 subjects (≥ 18 years of age) with refractory squamous cell carcinoma of the head
and neck. Subjects will receive direct intratumoral injection of a replication-defective type 5 adenovirus vector,
AD5CMV-p53, to deliver the normal human p53 tumor suppressor gene. The E1 region of AD5CMV-p53 has
been replaced with a p53 expression cassette containing the human cytomegalovirus promoter (CMV).
Subjects will be divided into 2 treatment groups: (1) those with non-resectable tumors, and (2) those with
surgically accessible tumors. Subjects will receive multiple injections of vector in each dose-escalation cohort.
Following vector administration, subjects will be isolated for 48 hours during which time, assays will be
conducted to demonstrate the lack of shedding of adenovirus vector. The objectives of the study are to
determine: (1) the maximum tolerated dose of AD5CMV-p53, (2) qualitative and quantitative toxicity related to
vector administration, and (3) biologic activity.

Medical Center, Portland, Oregon, may conduct gene transfer experiments on 18 subjects (≥ 18 years of age)
with metastatic renal cell carcinoma or melanoma. Autologous tumor cells will be surgically removed,
transduced in vitro with the cationic liposome plasmid vector, VCL-1005, which encodes human leukocyte
antigen (HLA)-B7 and beta-2 microglobulin. Subjects will receive subcutaneous injection of lethally irradiated
transduced cells in one limb. The contralateral limb will be injected with lethally irradiated untransduced tumor
cells in combination with Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG). Approximately 21 days following tumor cell injection,
subjects will undergo lymphadenectomy for subsequent in vitro expansion of anti-CD3 activated lymphocytes.
Activated lymphocytes will be adoptively transferred on approximately day 35 in combination with a 5-day
course of interleukin-2 (IL-2). On approximately day 45, subjects will receive a second cycle of IL-2. The
objectives of this study are to determine: (1) the safety of administering anti-CD3 activated antitumor effector T
cells in draining lymph nodes, and (2) whether HLA-B7/β-2 gene transfer augments the sensitization of antitumor effector T-cells in draining lymph nodes. (Protocol 9506-108)

Holt, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee, may conduct gene transfer experiments
on 15 male subjects (35 to 75 years of age) with metastatic prostate cancer. Malignant cells obtained from
advanced prostate cancer subjects have been demonstrated to express high levels of the protooncogene c-myc
in vivo. The mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) long terminal repeat (LTR) is expressed at high levels in
prostate tissue. Following removal of malignant cells via biopsy, subjects will receive a single transrectal
ultrasound-guided intraprostate quadrant injection of the retrovirus vector, XM6:MMTV-antisense c-myc, for 4
consecutive days at the site of the original biopsy. The objectives of this Phase I study are to: (1) quantitatively
assess the uptake and expression of XM6:MMTV-antisense c-myc by prostate cancer cells in vivo, (2)
determine whether c-myc gene expression is prostate tumor-specific, (3) assess safety of intraprostate injection
of XM6:MMTV-antisense c-myc, and (4) biologic efficacy (antisense inhibition of tumor growth). (Protocol

Appendix D-109. Drs. Ronald G. Crystal, Edward Hershowitz, and Michael Lieberman, New York HospitalCornell Medical Center, New York, New York, may conduct gene transfer experiments on 18 subjects (18 to 70
years of age) with metastatic colon carcinoma with liver metastases. In this Phase I dose-escalation study,
subjects will receive computed tomography (CT)-guided intratumoral injections of the adenovirus vector,
AdGVCD.10, into the same hepatic metastasis in 4 equal volumes (100 microliters), each with a separate entry
into the liver. This dosage schedule will be performed on Days 1 and 7. 5-fluorocytosine (200 milligrams/
kilogram/24 hours) will be administered orally in 4 equal doses starting on day 2 and continuing through the time
of laparotomy. The objectives of this study are to: (1) determine the dose-dependent toxicity of direct
administration of AdGVCD.10 to hepatic metastases combined with oral administration of 5-fluorocytosine, (2)
quantitatively assess transfer and expression of the cytosine deaminase gene in target cells, and (3) determine
the biologic effects of direct ADGVCD.10 administration to hepatic metastases. (Protocol #9509-125)
Appendix D-110. Drs. Andres Berchuck and H. Kim Lyerly of Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North
Carolina, may conduct gene transfer experiments on 18 subjects (≥ 18 years of age) with refractory metastatic
ovarian cancer. Autologous tumor cells obtained from ascites or surgically removed tumor will be transduced
with the cationic liposome vector, PMP6A-IL2, that contains an adeno-associated virus derived plasmid DNA, a
cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, and interleukin-2 (IL-2) complementary DNA (cDNA). In this dose-escalation
study, subjects will undergo 4 cycles of intradermal injections (thigh or abdomen) of ex vivo transduced, lethally
irradiated tumor cells in an attempt to induce an antitumor response. The objectives of the study are to
evaluate: (1) the safety of intradermally injected transduced cells, and (2) antitumor response following therapy.

Appendix D-111. Drs. Stephen L. Eck and Jane B. Alavi of the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center,
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, may conduct gene transfer experiments on 18 subjects (>18 years of age) with
malignant glioma. The adenovirus vector encoding the Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) gene,
H5.020RSVTK, will be injected by a stereotactic guided technique into brain tumors. Afterwards, the patients
will receive systemic ganciclovir (GCV) treatment. Patients eligible to undergo a palliative debulking procedure
will receive the same treatment followed by resection on day 7, and a second dose of the vector intraoperatively. Brain tissues removed by resection will be analyzed for adenovirus infection, transgene expression,
and signs of inflammation. The size and metabolic activity of tumors will be monitored by scanning with
magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography. The objective of the study is to evaluate the
overall safety of this treatment and to gain insight into the parameters that may limit the general applicability of
this approach. (Protocol #9409-089)
Appendix D-112. Drs. Robert Grossman and Savio Woo of the Baylor College of Medicine & Methodist
Hospital, Houston, Texas, may conduct gene transfer experiments on 20 subjects (≥ 18 years of age) with
refractive central nervous system malignancies. Subjects will receive stereotaxic injections of a replicationdefective, type 5 E1/E3-deleted adenovirus vector, ADV/RSV-tk, to deliver the Herpes simplex virus thymidine
kinase (HSV-TK) gene to tumor cells. Expression of the HSV-TK gene is driven by a Rous sarcoma virus long
terminal repeat (RSV-LTR). Subjects will receive a single time-course of intravenous ganciclovir (GCV) (14
consecutive days) following vector administration. Following demonstration of safety with the initial starting
dose of 1 x 108 particles in 5 subjects, additional cohorts will receive between 5 x 108 and 1.5 x 109 particles.
Each cohort will be monitored for toxicity for one month before administration of the next higher dose to
subsequent cohorts. Subjects will be monitored for evidence of clinical efficacy by magnetic resonance imaging
and/or computer tomography scans. The primary objective of this Phase I study is to determine the safety of
vector administration. (Protocol #9412-098)
Appendix D-113. Drs. Gabriel N. Hortobagyi, Gabriel Lopez-Berestein, and Mien-Chie Hung, of the University
of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, may conduct gene transfer experiments on a maximum
of 24 adult patients (12 for each cancer) with metastatic breast or ovarian carcinoma. Overexpression of the
HER-2/neu oncogene occurs in 30% of ovarian and breast cancers, and it is associated with enhanced
metastatic potential, drug resistance, and poor survival. The E1A gene of the adenovirus type 5 functions as a
tumor suppressor gene when transfected into cancer cells which overexpress the HER-2/neu oncogene. E1A
expression induces down regulation of the level of the HER-2/neu oncoprotein by a transcriptional control
mechanism. A plasmid, pE1A, encoding the adenovirus E1A gene with its own promoter will be administered as
a DNA/lipid complex via the intraperitoneal or intrapleural route. The objectives of the study are: (1) to
determine E1A gene transduction into malignant cells after the administration of E1A/lipid complex by
intrapleural or intraperitoneal administration, (2) to determine whether E1A gene therapy can down-regulate
HER-2/neu expression after intrapleural or intraperitoneal administration, (3) to determine the maximum
biologically active dose (MBAD), or the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of E1A/lipid complex, (4) to determine
the toxicity and tolerance of E1A/lipid complex administered into the pleural or peritoneal space, and to assess
the reversibility of such toxicity, and (5) to evaluate tumor response. (Protocol #9512-137)
Appendix D-114. Drs. Keith L. Black and Habib Fakhrai of the University of California, Los Angeles, California,
may conduct gene transfer experiments on 12 subjects (≥ 18 years of age) with glioblastoma multiform. An
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) based plasmid vector, pCEP-4/TGF- β2 antisense, encoding antisense RNA will be
used to inhibit TGF- β2 production. Tumor samples obtained from the patients at the time of clinically indicated
surgery will be grown in culture to establish a cell line for each patient. The patients' tumor cells will be
genetically altered with the pCEP-4/TGF-β2 vector to inhibit their secretion of TGF-β. Following completion of
the traditional post surgical radiation therapy, the first cohort of patients will receive, at 3 week intervals, 4
injections of 5 x 106 irradiated gene modified autologous tumor cells. Subsequently, in dose escalation studies,
the second cohort will receive 1 x 107 cells, and the third cohort, 2 x 107 cells. The results of this Phase I trial
will be used to assess the safety of this form of gene therapy and may provide preliminary data to evaluate the
potential utility of TGF- β2 antisense gene therapy in the management of gliomas. (Protocol #9512-138)
Appendix D-115. Dr. Ronald G. Crystal of New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, New York, New York,
may conduct gene transfer experiments on a total of 21 (with an option for an additional 5) normal males and
female subjects, age ≥ 18 years. Replication-deficient adenovirus (Ad) vector previously has been used in a
number of human gene therapy strategies to transfer genes in vivo for therapeutic purposes. The purpose of
this protocol is to characterize the local (skin), systemic (blood), and distant compartment (lung) immunity in
normal individuals after intradermal administration of a replication deficient Ad5-based vector, named
AdGVCD.10, carrying the gene coding for the E. coli enzyme, cytosine deaminase (CD). Following intradermal 
Page 68 - NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (April 2016)
administration of the vector to normal individuals, the skin, blood, and lung immune responses to the Ad vector
and CD transgene will be evaluated over time. This vector has been safety administered intrahepatically ten
times to five individuals with colon carcinoma. No adverse effects in Protocol #9509-125 have been observed.
The present protocol will yield insights into normal human immune responses to both the Ad vector, as well as
to a heterologous (i.e., non-human) gene product (CD). Note: This study is designed to answer basic biological
questions regarding characterization of the immune responses to such vectors that have been previously
documented. (Protocol #9701-171)

APPENDIX F. CONTAINMENT CONDITIONS FOR CLONING OF GENES CODING FOR THE
BIOSYNTHESIS OF MOLECULES TOXIC FOR VERTEBRATES
Appendix F-I. General Information
Appendix F specifies the containment to be used for the deliberate cloning of genes coding for the biosynthesis
of molecules toxic for vertebrates. The cloning of genes coding for molecules toxic for vertebrates that have an
LD50 of < 100 nanograms per kilograms body weight (e.g., microbial toxins such as the botulinum toxins, tetanus
toxin, diphtheria toxin, Shigella dysenteriae neurotoxin) are covered under Section III-B-1 (Experiments
Involving the Cloning of Toxin Molecules with LD50 of Less than 100 Nanograms Per Kilogram Body Weight) and
require Institutional Biosafety Committee and NIH OSP approval before initiation. No specific restrictions shall
apply to the cloning of genes if the protein specified by the gene has an LD50 ≥ 100 micrograms per kilograms of
body weight. Experiments involving genes coding for toxin molecules with an LD50 of < 100 micrograms per
kilograms and > 100 nanograms per kilograms body weight require Institutional Biosafety Committee approval
and registration with NIH OSP prior to initiating the experiments. A list of toxin molecules classified as to LD50 is
available from NIH OSP. Testing procedures for determining toxicity of toxin molecules not on the list are

APPENDIX G. PHYSICAL CONTAINMENT
Appendix G specifies physical containment for standard laboratory experiments and defines Biosafety Level 1
through Biosafety Level 4. For large-scale (over 10 liters) research or production, Appendix K (Physical
Containment for Large Scale Uses of Organisms Containing Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules)
supersedes Appendix G. Appendix K defines Good Large Scale Practice through Biosafety Level 3 - Large
Scale. For certain work with plants, Appendix P (Physical and Biological Containment for Recombinant or
Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecule Research Involving Plants) supersedes Appendix G. Appendix P defines
Biosafety Levels 1 through 4 - Plants. For certain work with animals, Appendix Q (Physical and Biological
Containment for Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecule Research Involving Animals) supersedes
Appendix G. Appendix Q defines Biosafety Levels 1 through 4 - Animals.
Appendix G-I. Standard Practices and Training
The first principle of containment is strict adherence to good microbiological practices (see Appendices G-III-A
through G-III-J, Footnotes and References of Appendix G). Consequently, all personnel directly or indirectly
involved in experiments using recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules shall receive adequate
instruction (see Sections IV-B-1-h, Responsibilities of the Institution--General Information, and IV-B-7-d,
Responsibilities of the Principal Investigator Prior to Initiating Research). At a minimum, these instructions
include training in aseptic techniques and in the biology of the organisms used in the experiments so that the
potential biohazards can be understood and appreciated.
Any research group working with agents that are known or potential biohazards shall have an emergency plan
that describes the procedures to be followed if an accident contaminates personnel or the environment. The
Principal Investigator shall ensure that everyone in the laboratory is familiar with both the potential hazards of
the work and the emergency plan (see Sections IV-B-7-d, Responsibilities of the Principal Investigator Prior to
Initiating Research and IV-B-7-e, Responsibilities of the Principal Investigator During the Conduct of the
Research). If a research group is working with a known pathogen for which there is an effective vaccine, the
vaccine should be made available to all workers. Serological monitoring, when clearly appropriate, will be
provided (see Section IV-B-1-f, Responsibilities of the Institution--General Information).
The Laboratory Safety Monograph (see Appendix G-III-O, Footnotes and References of Appendix G) and
Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (see Appendix G-III-A, Footnotes and References of
Appendix G) describe practices, equipment, and facilities in detail.
Appendix G-II. Physical Containment Levels
The objective of physical containment is to confine organisms containing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid
molecules and to reduce the potential for exposure of the laboratory worker, persons outside of the laboratory,
and the environment to organisms containing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules. Physical
containment is achieved through the use of laboratory practices, containment equipment, and special laboratory
design. Emphasis is placed on primary means of physical containment which are provided by laboratory
practices and containment equipment. Special laboratory design provides a secondary means of protection
against the accidental release of organisms outside the laboratory or to the environment. Special laboratory
design is used primarily in facilities in which experiments of moderate to high potential hazard are performed.
Combinations of laboratory practices, containment equipment, and special laboratory design can be made to
achieve different levels of physical containment. Four levels of physical containment, which are designated as
BL1, BL2, BL3, and BL4 are described. It should be emphasized that the descriptions and assignments of
physical containment detailed below are based on existing approaches to containment of pathogenic organisms
(see Appendix G-III-A, Footnotes and References of Appendix G). The National Cancer Institute describes
three levels for research on oncogenic viruses which roughly correspond to our BL2, BL3, and BL4 levels (see
Appendix G-III-C, Footnotes and References of Appendix G).
It is recognized that several different combinations of laboratory practices, containment equipment, and special
laboratory design may be appropriate for containment of specific research activities. The NIH Guidelines,
therefore, allow alternative selections of primary containment equipment within facilities that have been
designed to provide BL3 and BL4 levels of physical containment. The selection of alternative methods of
primary containment is dependent, however, on the level of biological containment provided by the host-vector
system used in the experiment. Consideration will be given to other combinations which achieve an equivalent 
Page 72 - NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (April 2016)
level of containment (see Sections IV-C-1-b-(1), Major Actions and IV-C-1-b-(2), Minor Actions).

gloves, shoe covers, and respirators. All personnel shall shower on exit from areas where these devices are
required.
Appendix G-II-C-2-n. All wastes from laboratories and animal rooms are appropriately decontaminated before
disposal. For research involving mammalian-transmissible HPAI H5N1 virus, liquid effluents should be
chemically disinfected or heat-treated, or collected and processed in a central effluent decontamination
system. Decontamination of shower and toilet effluents is not required, provided appropriate practices and
procedures are in place for primary containment of mammalian-transmissible HPAI H5N1 virus. Animal
tissues, carcasses, and bedding originating from the animal room must be decontaminated by an effective
and validated method (e.g., use of an autoclave) preferably before leaving the containment barrier. If waste
must be transported, special practices should be developed for transport of infectious materials to

using containment equipment specified for the BL4 level of physical containment. Alternative combination of
containment safeguards are shown in Appendix G-Table 1, Possible Alternate Combinations of Physical and
Biological Containment Safeguards.
Appendix G-II-C-3. Containment Equipment (BL3)
Appendix G-II-C-3-a. Biological safety cabinets (Class I, II, or III) (see Appendix G-III-L, Footnotes and 
Page 77 - NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (April 2016)
References of Appendix G) or other appropriate combinations of personal protective or physical containment
devices (e.g., special protective clothing, masks, gloves, respirators, centrifuge safety cups, sealed centrifuge
rotors, and containment caging for animals) are used for all activities with organisms containing recombinant or
synthetic nucleic acid molecules which pose a threat of aerosol exposure. These include: manipulation of
cultures and of those clinical or environmental materials which may be a source of aerosols; the aerosol
challenge of experimental animals; the harvesting of infected tissues or fluids from experimental animals and
embryonate eggs; and the necropsy of experimental animals.
Appendix G-II-C-4. Laboratory Facilities (BL3)
Appendix G-II-C-4-a. The laboratory is separated from areas which are open to unrestricted traffic flow within
the building. Passage through two sets of doors is the basic requirement for entry into the laboratory from
access corridors or other contiguous areas. Physical separation of the high containment laboratory from access
corridors or other laboratories or activities may be provided by a double-door clothes change room (showers
may be included), airlock, or other access facility which requires passage through two sets of doors before
entering the laboratory.
Appendix G-II-C-4-b. The interior surfaces of walls, floors, and ceilings are water resistant so that they can be
easily cleaned. Penetrations in these surfaces are sealed or capable of being sealed to facilitate
decontaminating the area.
Appendix G-II-C-4-c. Bench tops are impervious to water and resistant to acids, alkalis, organic solvents, and
moderate heat.
Appendix G-II-C-4-d. Laboratory furniture is sturdy and spaces between benches, cabinets, and equipment are
accessible for cleaning.

automatically operated and is located near the laboratory exit door.
Appendix G-II-C-4-f. Windows in the laboratory are closed and sealed.
Appendix G-II-C-4-g. Access doors to the laboratory or containment module are self-closing.
Appendix G-II-C-4-h. An autoclave for decontaminating laboratory wastes is available preferably within the
laboratory.
Appendix G-II-C-4-i. A ducted exhaust air ventilation system is provided. This system creates directional
airflow that draws air into the laboratory from uncontaminated spaces surrounding the laboratory. The exhaust
air is not recirculated to any other area of the building, is discharged to the outside, and is dispersed away from
the occupied areas and air intakes. Personnel shall verify that the direction of the airflow (into the laboratory) is
proper. The exhaust air from the laboratory room may be discharged to the outside without being filtered or
otherwise treated unless research is being conducted with mammaliantransmissible HPAI H5N1 virus. For
research with mammalian-transmissible HPAI H5N1 virus, exhaust air must be HEPA filtered and there must
be sealed ductwork from the containment barrier to the filter. In addition, the air handling system shall be
designed such that under failure conditions, the airflow will not be reversed and periodic verification, with
annual verification of the HEPA filters, shall be performed. Finally, backup power shall be available for
critical controls and instrumentation necessary to maintain containment.
Appendix G-II-C-4-j. The high efficiency particulate air/HEPA filtered exhaust air from Class I or Class II
biological safety cabinets is discharged directly to the outside or through the building exhaust system. Exhaust
air from Class I or II biological safety cabinets may be recirculated within the laboratory if the cabinet is tested
and certified at least every twelve months. If the HEPA-filtered exhaust air from Class I or II biological safety
cabinets is to be discharged to the outside through the building exhaust air system, it is connected to this
system in a manner (e.g., thimble unit connection (see Appendix G-III-L, Footnotes and References of Appendix
G)) that avoids any interference with the air balance of the cabinets or building exhaust system.
Appendix G-II-C-5. Biosafety Level 3 Enhanced for Research Involving Risk Group 3 Influenza

handling, and serum collection for research involving mammaliantransmissible HPAI H5N1 virus.
Appendix G-II-C-5-a. Containment, Practices, and Training for Research with Risk Group 3 Influenza
Viruses (BL3 Enhanced).
Appendix G-II-C-5-a-(1). In addition to standard BL3 practices, the following additional personal protective
equipment and practices shall be used: (1) Powered Air-purifying Respirators (PAPR) are worn. (2) Street
clothes are changed to protective suit (e.g., wrap-back disposable gown, olefin protective suit). (3) Double
gloves (disposable) are worn. For research with mammalian-transmissible HPAI H5N1 viruses, protective
sleeves shall be worn over the gown while working in a biosafety cabinet. (4) Appropriate shoe coverings are
worn (e.g., double disposable shoe coverings, single disposable shoe coverings if worn with footwear dedicated
to BL3 enhanced laboratory use, or impervious boots or shoes of rubber or other suitable material that can be
decontaminated). (5) Showers prior to exiting the laboratory should be considered depending on risk
assessment of research activities, with the exception that showers prior to exiting the laboratory are required
for all research with mammalian-transmissible HPAI H5N1 virus, including care of animals infected with
mammalian-transmissible HPAI H5N1 virus. (6) For research with mammalian-transmissible HPAI H5N1
virus, prior to leaving containment, personal protective equipment shall be sprayed or wiped down with a
disinfectant that has activity against influenza viruses. (7) In order to promote adherence to proper
practices, including proper removal of personal protective equipment, and reporting of any loss of
containment or exposures, at least two individuals should be in the laboratory at all times when research
with mammalian-transmissible HPAI H5N1 virus involves experimental procedures with animals or sharps, or
when procedures are being conducted whereby the generation of aerosols is reasonably anticipated.
Removal of personal protective equipment should be observed.
Appendix G-II-C-5-a-(2). As proper training of laboratory workers is an essential component of biosafety,
retraining and periodic reassessments (at least annually) in BL3 enhanced practices, especially the proper use
of respiratory equipment, such as PAPRs, and clothing changes are required. For research with mammaliantransmissible HPAI H5N1 virus, laboratory workers shall be required to sign a document acknowledging their
understanding of and intent to adhere to biosafety, biosecurity, and occupational health requirements. This
document shall include a statement that the laboratory worker agrees to report any exposures or accidents,
including those by other individuals in the lab.
Appendix G-II-C-5-a-(3). Reporting of all spills and accidents, even if relatively minor, is required as described
in Appendix G-II-C-2-q.
Appendix G-II-C-5-a-(4). To avoid inadvertent cross contamination of 1918 H1N1, HPAI H5N1 or human H2N2
(1957-1968): (1) Containment facilities and practices appropriate for highest Risk Group virus shall be used at
all times with lower Risk Group viruses, when studied in the same laboratory room. (2) Tissue cultures with
these viruses shall be conducted at separate times (temporal spacing) in the same room. (3) Separate reagents
shall be used to minimize risk of cross contamination. (4) A laboratory worker shall not perform concurrent
influenza virus experiments that carry the risk of unintended reassortment among 1918 H1N1, human H2N2
(1957-1968), HPAI H5N1 and other human influenza viruses. (5) Two or more laboratory workers shall not
perform within the same work area simultaneous influenza virus experiments that carry the risk of unintended
segment reassortment between 1918 H1N1, or HPAI H5N1, or human H2N2 (1957-1968) and other human
influenza viruses. (6) Between experiments good biosafety decontamination practices (e.g., surface and
biosafety cabinet surface decontamination according to standard BL3 procedures) shall be used and there shall
be a thirty minute wait period after decontamination before equipment is used for experiments with any other
influenza A viruses. (7) Between experiments, in addition to decontamination of the work area, clothing
changes and PAPR disinfection shall be performed prior to handling a different influenza virus in the same work
area. (Shower-out capability may be required by USDA/APHIS for certain experiments with HPAI H5N1.)
Appendix G-II-C-5-a-(5). Continued susceptibility of the reassortant influenza viruses containing genes and/or
segments from 1918 H1N1, HPAI H5N1, and human H2N2 (1957-1968) to antiviral agents shall be established
by sequence analysis or suitable biological assays. After manipulation of genes that influence sensitivity to
antiviral agents, susceptibility to these agents shall be reconfirmed. If susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitors
or other effective antiviral agents is lost as a result of genetic modification or serial passage of a mammaliantransmissible HPAI H5N1 virus, then any research with this antiviral agent resistant virus shall be stopped
and research shall only proceed after review by the NIH (as outlined in Section III-A-l-a) or the appropriate
federal regulatory agency.

Appendix G-II-C-5-b. Containment for Animal Research.
Guidance provided in Appendix G-II-C and Appendix Q-II-C is applicable with the following emphasis on
standard BL3 or BL3-N containment or additional enhancements.
Appendix G-II-C-5-b-(1). Research with small animals shall be conducted in a class II biosafety cabinet. Small
animals such as rodents (e.g. mice, hamsters, rats, guinea pigs) can be housed within a negative pressure BL3
animal suite using high-density individually vented caging (IVC) systems that independently supply high
efficiency particulate air/HEPA-filtered and directional air circulation. Other animals (e.g. rabbits, ferrets) that
are of a size or have growth or caging requirements that preclude the use of high-density IVC systems are to be
housed in negative pressure bioisolators.
Appendix G-II-C-5-b-(2). Large animals such as non-human primates shall be housed in primary barrier
environments according to BL3-N containment requirements (see Appendix Q-II-C).
Appendix G-II-C-5-b-(3). Specialized training and proven competency in all assigned practices and procedures
shall be required for laboratory staff, including staff involved in animal care.
Appendix G-II-C-5-b-(4). For HPAI H5N1 research, the NIH Guidelines defer to USDA/APHIS
recommendations for biocontainment practices for loose housed animals.
Appendix G-II-C-5-c. Occupational Health
A detailed occupational health plan shall be developed in advance of working with these agents in consultation,
as needed, with individuals with the appropriate clinical expertise. In addition, the appropriate public health
authority shall be consulted (e.g. local public health officials) on the plan and a mock drill of this plan shall be
undertaken periodically. The plan shall include a description of the incident reporting system in place for
incidents, which include any loss of containment, spills, accidents, or potential exposures. The plan must
specify that all incidents must be reported immediately to the appropriate institutional authorities, and no
later than 24 hours to the appropriate public health authorities (e.g., the USDA, the CDC, NIH, local and
state health authorities).
Appendix G-II-C-5-c-(1). Laboratory workers shall be provided with medical cards which include, at a
minimum, the following information: characterization of the influenza virus to which they have been potentially
exposed, and 24-hour contact numbers for the Principal Investigator and institution’s occupational health care
provider(s).
Appendix G-II-C-5-c-(2). A detailed occupational health plan shall include: (1) Unless there is a medical
contraindication to vaccination (e.g. severe egg allergy) annual seasonal influenza vaccination as prerequisite
for research to reduce risk of influenza like illness that would require isolation and testing to rule out infection
with experimental viruses and raise the risk for possible co-infection with circulating influenza strains. (2) Virus
specific vaccination, if available, should be offered and if a licensed HPAI H5N1 vaccine is available, and
there are no medical contraindications, laboratory workers performing research with mammaliantransmissible HPAI H5N1 virus should be vaccinated. A post-vaccination serum sample shall be collected,
assessed for immune response, and stored in accordance with institutional policy, at least for the time in
which the laboratory worker continues to conduct HPAI H5N1 virus research. (3) Reporting of all respiratory
symptoms and/or fever (i.e. influenza-like illnesses). For research involving mammalian-transmissible HPAI
H5N1 virus, laboratory workers shall be actively monitored for influenza-like illness (i.e., fever and
respiratory symptoms). (4) 24-hour access to a medical facility that is prepared to implement appropriate
respiratory isolation to prevent transmission and is able to provide appropriate antiviral agents. Real-time
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays should be used for virus detection and to
discriminate these viruses from currently circulating human influenza viruses. For exposures to viruses
containing genes from 1918 H1N1 or the HA gene from human H2N2 (1957-1968), specimens shall be sent to
the CDC for testing (RT-PCR and confirmatory sequencing).
Appendix G-II-C-5-c-(3). In preparing to perform research with 1918 H1N1, human H2N2 (1957-1968), or HPAI
H5N1, Principal Investigators should develop a clear plan specifying who will be contacted in the event of a
potential exposure (during and after work hours) to conduct a risk assessment and make decisions as to the
required response, including the need for and extent of isolation of the exposed worker. After any kind of
potential exposure, a rapid risk assessment shall be performed by the Principal Investigator, health and
biosafety officials and subsequent actions should depend on the appraised level of risk of respiratory infection 
Page 80 - NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (April 2016)
for the individual and potential for transmission to others. A laboratory worker performing research with either
an influenza virus containing the HA gene from human H2N2 or an influenza virus containing genes and/or
segments from 1918 H1N1 or mammalian-transmissible HPAI H5N1 viruses, shall be informed in advance that,
in the case of a known laboratory exposure with a high risk for infection, e.g., involving the upper or lower
respiratory tract or mucous membranes, the laboratory worker will need to be isolated in a predetermined
facility, rather than home isolation, until infection can be ruled out by testing (e.g., negative RT-PCR for 1918
H1N1 or human H2N2 (1957-1968), or HPAI H5N1) of appropriately timed specimens. Laboratory workers with
a known laboratory exposure with high risk for infection during research with HPAI H5N1 virus strains that
are not transmissible among mammals should be prepared to self-isolate (for example at home) until infection
can be ruled out by testing (e.g., negative RT-PCR for HPAI H5N1) of appropriately timed specimens. The
action taken for other types of exposures should be based on the risk assessment. In addition, based on the
risk assessment: (1) treatment with appropriate antiviral agents shall be initiated, and (2) the appropriate public
health authorities shall be notified.
Appendix G-II-C-5-c-(4). Influenza-like illness. If an individual has entered (within ten days) a laboratory
conducting research with influenza viruses containing the human H2N2 HA gene or any gene from the 1918
H1N1 or HPAI H5N1 viruses, or housing animals exposed to such viruses, and the individual demonstrates
symptoms and/or signs of influenza infection (e.g., fever/chills, cough, myalgias, headache), then he/she shall
report by phone to the supervisor/Principal Investigator and other individuals identified in the occupational health
plan. If needed, the person with influenza-like illness shall be transported, under the appropriate isolation
conditions, to a healthcare facility that can provide adequate respiratory isolation, appropriate medical therapy,
and testing to determine whether the infection is due to a recombinant or synthetic influenza virus. The
appropriate public health authorities shall be informed whenever a suspected case is isolated.
Appendix G-II-C-5-c-(5). For 1918 H1N1 research, the use of antiviral agents (e.g., oseltamivir) for preexposure prophylaxis shall be discussed with laboratory workers in advance including a discussion of the data
on the safety of long term exposure to these agents and their ability to reduce the risk of clinical disease and the
limits of the data regarding protection of close contacts and the community.
Appendix G-II-C-5-c-(6). Antiviral agents for postexposure prophylaxis shall be provided only after medical
evaluation. Home supplies shall not be provided in advance for research with 1918 H1N1, mammaliantransmissible HPAI H5N1 or influenza viruses containing the HA gene from human H2N2.
Appendix G-II-D. Biosafety Level 4 (BL4)
Appendix G-II-D-1. Standard Microbiological Practices (BL4)
Appendix G-II-D-1-a. Work surfaces are decontaminated at least once a day and immediately after any spill of
viable material.
Appendix G-II-D-1-b. Only mechanical pipetting devices are used.
Appendix G-II-D-1-c. Eating, drinking, smoking, storing food, and applying cosmetics are not permitted in the
laboratory.
Appendix G-II-D-1-d. All procedures are performed carefully to minimize the creation of aerosols.
Appendix G-II-D-2. Special Practices (BL4)
Appendix G-II-D-2-a. Biological materials to be removed from the Class III cabinets or from the maximum
containment laboratory in a viable or intact state are transferred to a non-breakable, sealed primary container
and then enclosed in a non-breakable, sealed secondary container which is removed from the facility through a
disinfectant dunk tank, fumigation chamber, or an airlock designed for this purpose.
Appendix G-II-D-2-b. No materials, except for biological materials that are to remain in a viable or intact state,
are removed from the maximum containment laboratory unless they have been autoclaved or decontaminated
before exiting the facility. Equipment or material which might be damaged by high temperatures or steam is
decontaminated by gaseous or vapor methods in an airlock or chamber designed for this purpose.
Page 81 - NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (April 2016)
Appendix G-II-D-2-c. Only persons whose presence in the facility or individual laboratory rooms is required for
program or support purposes are authorized to enter. The supervisor has the final responsibility for assessing
each circumstance and determining who may enter or work in the laboratory. Access to the facility is limited by
means of secure, locked doors; accessibility is managed by the Principal Investigator, Biological Safety Officer,
or other person responsible for the physical security of the facility. Before entering, persons are advised of the
potential biohazards and instructed as to appropriate safeguards for ensuring their safety. Authorized persons
comply with the instructions and all other applicable entry and exit procedures. A logbook signed by all
personnel indicates the date and time of each entry and exit. Practical and effective protocols for emergency
situations are established.
Appendix G-II-D-2-d. Personnel enter and exit the facility only through the clothing change and shower rooms.
Personnel shower each time they exit the facility. Personnel use the air locks to enter or exit the laboratory only
in an emergency.
Appendix G-II-D-2-e. Street clothing is removed in the outer clothing change room and kept there. Complete
laboratory clothing (may be disposable), including undergarments, pants and shirts or jump suits, shoes, and
gloves, is provided and used by all personnel entering the facility. Head covers are provided for personnel who
do not wash their hair during the exit shower. When exiting the laboratory and before proceeding into the
shower area, personnel remove their laboratory clothing and store it in a locker or hamper in the inner change
room. Protective clothing shall be decontaminated prior to laundering or disposal.
Appendix G-II-D-2-f. When materials that contain organisms containing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid
molecules or experimental animals are present in the laboratory or animal rooms, a hazard warning sign
incorporating the universal biosafety symbol is posted on all access doors. The sign identifies the agent, lists
the name of the Principal Investigator or other responsible person(s), and indicates any special requirements for
entering the area (e.g., the need for immunizations or respirators).
Appendix G-II-D-2-g. Supplies and materials needed in the facility are brought in by way of the double-doored
autoclave, fumigation chamber, or airlock which is appropriately decontaminated between each use. After
securing the outer doors, personnel within the facility retrieve the materials by opening the interior doors or the
autoclave, fumigation chamber, or airlock. These doors are secured after materials are brought into the facility.
Appendix G-II-D-2-h. An insect and rodent control program is in effect.
Appendix G-II-D-2-i. Materials (e.g., plants, animals, and clothing) not related to the experiment being
conducted are not permitted in the facility.
Appendix G-II-D-2-j. Hypodermic needles and syringes are used only for parenteral injection and aspiration of
fluids from laboratory animals and diaphragm bottles. Only needle-locking syringes or disposable syringeneedle units (i.e., needle is integral part of unit) are used for the injection or aspiration of fluids containing
organisms that contain recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules. Needles should not be bent, sheared,
replaced in the needle sheath or guard, or removed from the syringe following use. The needle and syringe
should be placed in a puncture-resistant container and decontaminated, preferably by autoclaving before
discard or reuse. Whenever possible, cannulas are used instead of sharp needles (e.g., gavage).
Appendix G-II-D-2-k. A system is set up for reporting laboratory accidents, exposures, employee absenteeism,
and for the medical surveillance of potential laboratory-associated illnesses. Spills and accidents which result in
overt exposures to organisms containing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules are immediately
reported to the Biological Safety Officer, Institutional Biosafety Committee, and NIH OSP. Reports to the NIH
OSP shall be sent to the Office of Science Policy, National Institutes of Health, preferably by e-mail to:
NIHGuidelines@od.nih.gov; additional contact information is also available here and on the OSP website
(www.osp.od.nih.gov). Written records are prepared and maintained. An essential adjunct to such a reportingsurveillance system is the availability of a facility for quarantine, isolation, and medical care of personnel with
potential or known laboratory associated illnesses.
Appendix G-II-D-2-l. Containment for Animal Research
Appendix G-II-D-2-l-(1). Laboratory animals involved in experiments requiring BL4 level physical containment
shall be housed either in cages contained in Class III cabinets or in partial containment caging systems, such as 
Page 82 - NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (April 2016)
Horsfall units (see Appendix G-III-K, Footnotes and References of Appendix G), open cages placed in ventilated
enclosures, or solid-wall and -bottom cages placed on holding racks equipped with ultraviolet irradiation lamps
and reflectors that are located in a specially designed area in which all personnel are required to wear one-piece
positive pressure suits.
Appendix G-II-D-2-l-(2). Non-human primates (NHP) may be housed (1) under the containment conditions
described in Appendix G-II-D-2-l-(1) above, or (2) in open cages within a dedicated animal holding room that
serves as the primary barrier and in which all personnel are required to wear one-piece positive pressure suits.
A room serving as a primary barrier must be air-tight and capable of being decontaminated using fumigation.
If NHPs are to be contained in a dedicated animal holding room serving as the primary barrier, the following
conditions shall be met:
(i) Access to the animal holding room from service corridors outside of the BL4 containment space shall require
passage through two sets of doors, and the inner most door must be an air pressure resistant (APR) door;
(ii) For any animal holding room considered to be a primary barrier, APR door(s) providing direct ingress from
the exterior service corridor shall be fitted with appropriate and redundant lock-out mechanisms to prevent
access when the animal holding room is contaminated and in use. There should be more than one mechanism
to ensure that this primary barrier door cannot be opened when the animal room is contaminated and the APR
door shall not serve as an emergency exit from the BL4 laboratory. The APR door shall be appropriately tested
to demonstrate that in the closed, locked-out mode, the door provides an air-tight barrier proven by pressure
decay testing or other equivalent method;
(iii) Any door(s) allowing access into a corridor from which there is direct ingress to an animal holding room must
be fitted with either (1) an APR door or (2) a non-APR door, provided directional airflow is maintained from the
laboratory corridor space into the animal room. For the purpose of fumigation, animal rooms equipped with nonAPR doors opening into the adjacent interior corridors shall be considered one space (i.e., areas between airtight doors shall be fumigated together);
(iv) Any door(s) used for access to the service corridor (the secondary barrier) shall be self-closing and of solid
construction, designed not to corrode, split or warp;
(v) Access to the service corridor inside the secondary barrier shall be restricted and strictly controlled when
animal rooms are in use. Whenever possible, the secondary barrier door(s) should be fitted with safety interlock
switches designed to prevent it from opening when an animal holding room door (the primary barrier) is opened
following room decontamination; if interlock devices cannot be used, specific administrative procedures shall be
implemented to control access to the service corridor;
(vi) The service corridor shall maintain a negative pressure (inward directional airflow) relative to adjoining traffic
corridors;
(vii) Prior to fumigation of the animal holding room, cages should be removed for autoclaving or chemical
decontamination;
(viii) Caging should be chosen to reduce the amount of animal detritus that can be thrown out of the cage and
onto the floor of the animal holding room;
(ix) The flow of personnel, material and equipment should be directed in order to minimize the spread of
contamination from the animal holding room into adjacent areas of the laboratory;
(x) Following animal room decontamination, safeguards involving the use of personal protective equipment and
appropriate administrative controls shall be implemented for the safe retrieval of biological indicators in order to
prevent the spread of infectious agents in the event of a decontamination failure.
Appendix G-II-D-2-m. Alternative Selection of Containment Equipment (BL4)
Experimental procedures involving a host-vector system that provides a one-step higher level of biological
containment than that specified may be conducted in the BL4 facility using containment equipment requirements
specified for the BL3 level of physical containment. Alternative combinations of containment safeguards are
shown in Appendix G-Table 1, Possible Alternate Combinations of Physical and Biological Containment
Safeguards.
Appendix G-II-D-3. Containment Equipment (BL4)
Appendix G-II-D-3-a. All procedures within the facility with agents assigned to Biosafety Level 4 are conducted
in the Class III biological safety cabinet or in Class I or II biological safety cabinets used in conjunction with onepiece positive pressure personnel suits ventilated by a life-support system.
Page 83 - NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (April 2016)
Appendix G-II-D-4. Laboratory Facilities (BL4)
Appendix G-II-D-4-a. The maximum containment facility consists of either a separate building or a clearly
demarcated and isolated zone within a building. Outer and inner change rooms separated by a shower are
provided for personnel entering and exiting the facility. A double-doored autoclave, fumigation chamber, or
ventilated airlock is provided for passage of those materials, supplies, or equipment which are not brought into
the facility through the change room.
Appendix G-II-D-4-b. Walls, floors, and ceilings of the facility are constructed to form a sealed internal shell
which facilitates fumigation and is animal and insect proof. The internal surfaces of this shell are resistant to
liquids and chemicals, thus facilitating cleaning and decontamination of the area. All penetrations in these
structures and surfaces are sealed. Any drains in the floors contain traps filled with a chemical disinfectant of
demonstrated efficacy against the target agent, and they are connected directly to the liquid waste
decontamination system. Sewer and other ventilation lines contain high efficiency particulate air/HEPA filters.
Appendix G-II-D-4-c. Internal facility appurtenances, such as light fixtures, air ducts, and utility pipes, are
arranged to minimize the horizontal surface area on which dust can settle.
Appendix G-II-D-4-d. Bench tops have seamless surfaces which are impervious to water and resistant to
acids, alkalis, organic solvents, and moderate heat.
Appendix G-II-D-4-e. Laboratory furniture is simple and of sturdy construction; and spaces between benches,
cabinets, and equipment are accessible for cleaning.
Appendix G-II-D-4-f. A foot, elbow, or automatically operated hand washing sink is provided near the door of
each laboratory room in the facility.
Appendix G-II-D-4-g. If there is a central vacuum system, it does not serve areas outside the facility. In-line
high efficiency particulate air/HEPA filters are placed as near as practicable to each use point or service cock.
Filters are installed to permit in-place decontamination and replacement. Other liquid and gas services to the
facility are protected by devices that prevent back-flow.
Appendix G-II-D-4-h. If water fountains are provided, they are foot operated and are located in the facility
corridors outside the laboratory. The water service to the fountain is not connected to the back-flow protected
distribution system supplying water to the laboratory areas.
Appendix G-II-D-4-i. Access doors to the laboratory are self-closing and locking.
Appendix G-II-D-4-j. Any windows are breakage resistant.
Appendix G-II-D-4-k. A double-door autoclave is provided for decontaminating materials passing out of the
facility. The autoclave door which opens to the area external to the facility is sealed to the outer wall and
automatically controlled so that the outside door can only be opened after the autoclave "sterilization" cycle has
been completed.
Appendix G-II-D-4-l. A pass-through dunk tank, fumigation chamber, or an equivalent decontamination method
is provided so that materials and equipment that cannot be decontaminated in the autoclave can be safely
removed from the facility.
Appendix G-II-D-4-m. Liquid effluent from laboratory sinks, biological safety cabinets, floors, and autoclave
chambers are decontaminated by heat treatment before being released from the maximum containment facility.
Liquid wastes from shower rooms and toilets may be decontaminated with chemical disinfectants or by heat in
the liquid waste decontamination system. The procedure used for heat decontamination of liquid wastes is
evaluated mechanically and biologically by using a recording thermometer and an indicator microorganism with
a defined heat susceptibility pattern. If liquid wastes from the shower room are decontaminated with chemical
disinfectants, the chemical used is of demonstrated efficacy against the target or indicator microorganisms.
Appendix G-II-D-4-n. An individual supply and exhaust air ventilation system is provided. The system
maintains pressure differentials and directional airflow as required to assure flows inward from areas outside of
the facility toward areas of highest potential risk within the facility. Manometers are used to sense pressure 
Page 84 - NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (April 2016)
differentials between adjacent areas maintained at different pressure levels. If a system malfunctions, the
manometers sound an alarm. The supply and exhaust airflow is interlocked to assure inward (or zero) airflow at
all times.
Appendix G-II-D-4-o. The exhaust air from the facility is filtered through high efficiency particulate air/HEPA
filters and discharged to the outside so that it is dispersed away from occupied buildings and air intakes. Within
the facility, the filters are located as near the laboratories as practicable in order to reduce the length of
potentially contaminated air ducts. The filter chambers are designed to allow in situ decontamination before
filters are removed and to facilitate certification testing after they are replaced. Coarse filters and HEPA filters
are provided to treat air supplied to the facility in order to increase the lifetime of the exhaust HEPA filters and to
protect the supply air system should air pressures become unbalanced in the laboratory.
Appendix G-II-D-4-p. The treated exhaust air from Class I and II biological safety cabinets may be discharged
into the laboratory room environment or the outside through the facility air exhaust system. If exhaust air from
Class I or II biological safety cabinets is discharged into the laboratory the cabinets are tested and certified at
minimum on a yearly basis. More frequent testing and certification, based on the amount of use or other safety
factors, shall be left to the discretion of the IBC. The exhaust air from Class III biological safety cabinets is
discharged, without recirculation through two sets of high efficiency particulate air/HEPA filters in series, via the
facility exhaust air system. If the treated exhaust air from any of these cabinets is discharged to the outside
through the facility exhaust air system, it is connected to this system in a manner (e.g., thimble unit connection
(see Appendix G-III-L, Footnotes and References of Appendix G)) that avoids any interference with the air
balance of the cabinets or the facility exhaust air system.
Appendix G-II-D-4-q. A specially designed suit area may be provided in the facility. Personnel who enter this
area shall wear a one-piece positive pressure suit that is ventilated by a life-support system. The life-support
system includes alarms and emergency backup breathing air tanks. Entry to this area is through an airlock fitted
with airtight doors. A chemical shower is provided to decontaminate the surface of the suit before the worker
exits the area. The exhaust air from the suit area is filtered by two sets of high efficiency particulate air/HEPA
filters installed in series. A duplicate filtration unit, exhaust fan, and an automatically starting emergency power
source are provided. The air pressure within the suit area is greater than that of any adjacent area. Emergency
lighting and communication systems are provided. All penetrations into the internal shell of the suit are sealed.
A double-doored autoclave is provided for decontaminating waste materials to be removed from the suit areas.

Appendix G-III-L. Biological safety cabinets referred to in this section are classified as Class I, Class II, or
Class III cabinets. A Class I is a ventilated cabinet for personnel protection having an inward flow of air away
from the operator. The exhaust air from this cabinet is filtered through a high efficiency particulate air/HEPA
filter. This cabinet is used in three operational modes: (i) with a full-width open front, (ii) with an installed front
closure panel (having four 6-inch diameter openings) without gloves, and (iii) with an installed front closure
panel equipped with arm-length rubber gloves. The face velocity of the inward flow of air through the full-width
open front is 75 feet per minute or greater. A Class II cabinet is a ventilated cabinet for personnel and product
protection having an open front with inward air flow for personnel protection, and HEPA filtered mass
recirculated air flow for product protection. The cabinet exhaust air is filtered through a HEPA filter. The face
velocity of the inward flow of air through the full-width open front is 75 feet per minute or greater. Design and
performance specifications for Class II cabinets have been adopted by the National Sanitation Foundation, Ann
Arbor, Michigan. A Class III cabinet is a closed-front ventilated cabinet of gas tight construction which provides
the highest level of personnel protection of all biosafety safety cabinets. The interior of the cabinet is protected
from contaminants exterior to the cabinet. The cabinet is fitted with arm-length rubber gloves and is operated
under a negative pressure of at least 0.5 inches water gauge. All supply air is filtered through HEPA filters.
Exhaust air is filtered through two HEPA filters or one HEPA filter and incinerator before being discharged to the
outside environment. National Sanitation Foundation Standard 49. 1976. Class II (Laminar Flow) Biohazard

Appendix G-III-M. Biosafety Level 1 is suitable for work involving agents of unknown or minimal potential
hazard to laboratory personnel and the environment. The laboratory is not separated from the general traffic
patterns in the building. Work is generally conducted on open bench tops. Special containment equipment is
not required or generally used. Laboratory personnel have specific training in the procedures conducted in the
laboratory and are supervised by a scientist with general training in microbiology or a related science (see
Appendix G-III-A, Footnotes and References of Appendix G).
Appendix G-III-N. Biosafety Level 2 is similar to Level 1 and is suitable for work involving agents of moderate
potential hazard to personnel and the environment. It differs in that: (1) laboratory personnel have specific
training in handling pathogenic agents and are directed by competent scientists; (2) access to the laboratory is
limited when work is being conducted; and (3) certain procedures in which infectious aerosols are created are
conducted in biological safety cabinets or other physical containment equipment (see Appendix G-III-A,
Footnotes and References of Appendix G).

Appendix G-III-P. Biosafety Level 3 is applicable to clinical, diagnostic, teaching, research, or production
facilities in which work is conducted with indigenous or exotic agents which may cause serious or potentially
lethal disease as a result of exposure by the inhalation route. Laboratory personnel have specific training in
handling pathogenic and potentially lethal agents and are supervised by competent scientists who are
experienced in working with these agents. All procedures involving the manipulation of infectious material are
conducted within biological safety cabinets or other physical containment devices or by personnel wearing
appropriate personal protective clothing and devices. The laboratory has special engineering and design
features. It is recognized, however, that many existing facilities may not have all the facility safeguards
recommended for BL3 (e.g., access zone, sealed penetrations, and directional airflow, etc.). In these
circumstances, acceptable safety may be achieved for routine or repetitive operations (e.g., diagnostic
procedures involving the propagation of an agent for identification, typing, and susceptibility testing) in
laboratories where facility features satisfy BL2 recommendations provided the recommended "Standard
Microbiological Practices," "Special Practices," and "Containment Equipment" for BL3 are rigorously followed.
The decision to implement this modification of BL3 recommendations should be made only by the Principal
Investigator.

APPENDIX I. BIOLOGICAL CONTAINMENT (See Appendix E, Certified Host-Vector Systems)
Appendix I-I. Levels of Biological Containment
In consideration of biological containment, the vector (plasmid, organelle, or virus) for the recombinant or
synthetic nucleic acid molecule and the host (bacterial, plant, or animal cell) in which the vector is propagated in
the laboratory will be considered together. Any combination of vector and host which is to provide biological
containment shall be chosen or constructed so that the following types of "escape" are minimized: (i) survival of
the vector in its host outside the laboratory, and (ii) transmission of the vector from the propagation host to other
non-laboratory hosts. The following levels of biological containment (host-vector systems) for prokaryotes are
established. Appendices I-I-A through I-II-B describe levels of biological containment (host-vector systems) for
prokaryotes. Specific criteria will depend on the organisms to be used.
Appendix I-I-A. Host-Vector 1 Systems
Host-Vector 1 systems provide a moderate level of containment. Specific Host-Vector 1 systems are:
Appendix I-I-A-1. Escherichia coli K-12 Host-Vector 1 Systems (EK1)
The host is always Escherichia coli K-12 or a derivative thereof, and the vectors include non-conjugative
plasmids (e.g., pSC101, Co1E1, or derivatives thereof (see Appendices I-III-A through G, Footnotes and
References of Appendix I) and variants of bacteriophage, such as lambda (see Appendices I-III-H through O,
Footnotes and References of Appendix I). The Escherichia coli K-12 hosts shall not contain conjugationproficient plasmids, whether autonomous or integrated, or generalized transducing phages.
Appendix I-I-A-2. Other Host-Vector 1 Systems
At a minimum, hosts and vectors shall be comparable in containment to Escherichia coli K-12 with a nonconjugative plasmid or bacteriophage vector. Appendix I-II, Certification of Host-Vector Systems, describes the
data to be considered and mechanism for approval of Host-Vector 1 systems.
Appendix I-I-B. Host-Vector 2 Systems (EK2)
Host-Vector 2 Systems provide a high level of biological containment as demonstrated by data from suitable
tests performed in the laboratory. Escape of the recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule either via
survival of the organisms or via transmission of the recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule to other
organisms should be < 1/108 under specified conditions. Specific Host-Vector 2 systems are:
Appendix I-I-B-1. For Escherichia coli K-12 Host-Vector 2 systems (EK2) in which the vector is a plasmid, no 
Page 88 - NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (April 2016)
more than 1/108 host cells shall perpetuate a cloned DNA fragment under the specified non-permissive
laboratory conditions designed to represent the natural environment, either by survival of the original host or as
a consequence of transmission of the cloned DNA fragment.
Appendix I-I-B-2. For Escherichia coli K-12 Host-Vector 2 systems (EK2) in which the vector is a phage, no
more than 1/108 phage particles shall perpetuate a cloned DNA fragment under the specified non-permissive
laboratory conditions designed to represent the natural environment, either as a prophage (in the inserted or
plasmid form) in the laboratory host used for phage propagation, or survival in natural environments and
transferring a cloned DNA fragment to other hosts (or their resident prophages).
Appendix I-II. Certification of Host-Vector Systems
Appendix I-II-A. Responsibility
Host-Vector 1 systems (other than Escherichia coli K-12) and Host-Vector 2 systems may not be designated as
such until they have been certified by the NIH Director. Requests for certification of host-vector systems may be
submitted to the Office of Science Policy, National Institutes of Health, preferably by e-mail to:
NIHGuidelines@od.nih.gov; additional contact information is also available here and on the OSP website
(www.osp.od.nih.gov). Proposed host-vector systems will be reviewed by the RAC (see Section IV-C-1-b-(1)-
(f), Major Actions). Initial review will based on the construction, properties, and testing of the proposed hostvector system by a subcommittee composed of one or more RAC members and/or ad hoc experts. The RAC
will evaluate the subcommittee's report and any other available information at the next scheduled RAC meeting.
The NIH Director is responsible for certification of host-vector systems, following advice of the RAC. Minor
modifications to existing host-vector systems (i.e., those that are of minimal or no consequence to the
properties relevant to containment) may be certified by the NIH Director without prior RAC review (see Section
IV-C-1-b-(2)-(f), Minor Actions). Once a host-vector system has been certified by the NIH Director, a notice of
certification will be sent by NIH OSP to the applicant and to the Institutional Biosafety Committee Chairs. A list
of all currently certified host-vector systems is available from the Office of Science Policy, National Institutes of
Health, preferably by submitting a request for this information to: NIHGuidelines@od.nih.gov; additional contact
information is also available here and on the OSP website (www.osp.od.nih.gov). The NIH Director may rescind
the certification of a host-vector system (see Section IV-C-1-b-(2)-(g), Minor Actions). If certification is
rescinded, NIH will instruct investigators to transfer cloned DNA into a different system or use the clones at a
higher level of physical containment level, unless NIH determines that the already constructed clones
incorporate adequate biological containment. Certification of a host-vector system does not extend to
modifications of either the host or vector component of that system. Such modified systems shall be
independently certified by the NIH Director. If modifications are minor, it may only be necessary for the
investigator to submit data showing that the modifications have either improved or not impaired the major
phenotypic traits on which the containment of the system depends. Substantial modifications to a certified hostvector system requires submission of complete testing data.
Appendix I-II-B. Data to be Submitted for Certification
Appendix I-II-B-1. Host-Vector 1 Systems Other than Escherichia coli K-12
The following types of data shall be submitted, modified as appropriate for the particular system under
consideration: (i) a description of the organism and vector; the strain's natural habitat and growth requirements;
its physiological properties, particularly those related to its reproduction, survival, and the mechanisms by which
it exchanges genetic information; the range of organisms with which this organism normally exchanges genetic
information and the type of information is exchanged; and any relevant information about its pathogenicity or
toxicity; (ii) a description of the history of the particular strains and vectors to be used, including data on any
mutations which render this organism less able to survive or transmit genetic information; and (iii) a general
description of the range of experiments contemplated with emphasis on the need for developing such an HostVector 1 system.
Appendix I-II-B-2. Host-Vector 2 Systems
Investigators planning to request Host-Vector 2 systems certification may obtain instructions from NIH OSP
concerning data to be submitted (see Appendices I-III-N and O, Footnotes and References of Appendix I). In
general, the following types of data are required: (i) description of construction steps with indication of source,
properties, and manner of introduction of genetic traits; (ii) quantitative data on the stability of genetic traits that 
Page 89 - NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (April 2016)
contribute to the containment of the system; (iii) data on the survival of the host-vector system under nonpermissive laboratory conditions designed to represent the relevant natural environment; (iv) data on
transmissibility of the vector and/or a cloned DNA fragment under both permissive and non-permissive
conditions; (v) data on all other properties of the system which affect containment and utility, including
information on yields of phage or plasmid molecules, ease of DNA isolation, and ease of transfection or
transformation; and (vi) in some cases, the investigator may be asked to submit data on survival and vector
transmissibility from experiments in which the host-vector is fed to laboratory animals or one or more human
subjects. Such in vivo data may be required to confirm the validity of predicting in vivo survival on the basis of in
vitro experiments. Data shall be submitted 12 weeks prior to the RAC meeting at which such data will be
considered by the Office of Science Policy, National Institutes of Health, preferably by e-mail to:
NIHGuidelines@od.nih.gov; additional contact information is also available here and on the OSP website
(www.osp.od.nih.gov). Investigators are encouraged to publish their data on the construction, properties, and
testing of proposed Host Vector 2 systems prior to consideration of the system by the RAC and its
subcommittee. Specific instructions concerning the submission of data for proposed Escherichia coli K-12 HostVector 2 system (EK2) involving either plasmids or bacteriophage in Escherichia coli K-12, are available from
the Office of Science Policy, National Institutes of Health, preferably by submitting a request for this information
to: NIHGuidelines@od.nih.gov; additional contact information is also available here and on the OSP website
(www.osp.od.nih.gov).

APPENDIX J. BIOTECHNOLOGY RESEARCH SUBCOMMITTEE
The National Science and Technology Council's Committee on Fundamental Science determined that a
subcommittee should be continued to identify and coordinate Federal research efforts, identify research needs,
stimulating international cooperation, and assess national and international policy issues concerning
biotechnology sciences. The primary emphasis will be on scientific issues to increase the overall effectiveness
and productivity of the Federal investment in biotechnology sciences, especially regarding issues which cut
across agency boundaries. This subcommittee is called the Biotechnology Research Subcommittee.
Membership of the Biotechnology Research Subcommittee will include Federal agencies that support
biotechnology research. Agencies represented are: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Department of Commerce,
Department of Defense, Department of Energy, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of
Interior, Department of Justice, Department of State, Department of Veterans Affairs, Agency for International
Development, Environmental Protection Agency, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and National
Science Foundation. The Biotechnology Research Subcommittee will function in an advisory capacity to the
Committee on Fundamental Science, the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the
Executive Office of the President. The Biotechnology Research Subcommittee will review the scientific aspects
of proposed regulations and guidelines as they are developed.
The primary responsibilities of the Biotechnology Research Subcommittee are to: (i) describe and review
current Federal efforts in biotechnology research; (ii) identify and define the priority areas for future Federal
biotechnology research, including areas needing greater emphasis, describing the role of each agency in those
areas, and delineate where interagency cooperation would enhance progress in the biotechnology sciences,
with an emphasis on integrated research efforts, where appropriate; (iii) assess major international efforts in the
biotechnology sciences and develop mechanisms for international collaboration. For example, activities of the
U.S.-European Community Task Force on Biotechnology have been coordinated through the Biotechnology
Research Subcommittee; (iv) identify and review national and international policy issues (such as public
education) associated with biotechnology; and (v) provide reviews, analyses, and recommendations to the
Chairs of the Committee on Fundamental Science on scientific issues related to regulations and the applications
of biotechnology research and biotechnology policies and issues.
In 1990, the Biotechnology Research Subcommittee replaced the Biotechnology Sciences Coordinating
Committee. Both the Biotechnology Research Subcommittee and the Biotechnology Sciences Coordinating
Committee previously functioned under the Federal Coordinating Council on Science, Engineering, and
Technology (FCCSET). While regulatory issues became the primary focus of the Biotechnology Sciences
Coordinating Committee, the Biotechnology Research Subcommittee focuses on scientific issues, although it
will still provide scientific support for regulatory responsibilities.

APPENDIX K. PHYSICAL CONTAINMENT FOR LARGE SCALE USES OF ORGANISMS CONTAINING
RECOMBINANT OR SYNTHETIC NUCLEIC ACID MOLECULES
Appendix K specifies physical containment guidelines for large-scale (greater than 10 liters of culture) research
or production involving viable organisms containing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules. It shall
apply to large-scale research or production activities as specified in Section III-D-6, Experiments Involving More
than 10 Liters of Culture. It is important to note that this appendix addresses only the biological hazard
associated with organisms containing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules. Other hazards 
Page 91 - NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (April 2016)
accompanying the large-scale cultivation of such organisms (e.g., toxic properties of products; physical,
mechanical, and chemical aspects of downstream processing) are not addressed and shall be considered
separately, albeit in conjunction with this appendix.
All provisions shall apply to large-scale research or production activities with the following modifications: (i)
Appendix K shall supersede Appendix G, Physical Containment, when quantities in excess of 10 liters of culture
are involved in research or production. Appendix K-II applies to Good Large Scale Practice; (ii) the institution
shall appoint a Biological Safety Officer if it engages in large-scale research or production activities involving
viable organisms containing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules. The duties of the Biological
Safety Officer shall include those specified in Section IV-B-3, Biological Safety Officer; (iii) the institution shall
establish and maintain a health surveillance program for personnel engaged in large-scale research or
production activities involving viable organisms containing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules
which require Biosafety Level (BL) 3 containment at the laboratory scale. The program shall include: pre
assignment and periodic physical and medical examinations; collection, maintenance, and analysis of serum
specimens for monitoring serologic changes that may result from the employee's work experience; and
provisions for the investigation of any serious, unusual, or extended illnesses of employees to determine
possible occupational origin.
Appendix K-I. Selection of Physical Containment Levels
The selection of the physical containment level required for recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule
research or production involving more than 10 liters of culture is based on the containment guidelines
established in Section III, Experiments Covered by the NIH Guidelines. For purposes of large-scale research or
production, four physical containment levels are established. The four levels set containment conditions at
those appropriate for the degree of hazard to health or the environment posed by the organism, judged by
experience with similar organisms unmodified by recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule techniques and
consistent with Good Large Scale Practice. The four biosafety levels of large-scale physical containment are
referred to as Good Large Scale Practice, BL1-Large Scale, BL2-Large Scale, and BL3-Large Scale. Good
Large Scale Practice is recommended for large-scale research or production involving viable, non-pathogenic,
and non-toxigenic recombinant or synthetic strains derived from host organisms that have an extended history
of safe large-scale use. Good Large Scale Practice is recommended for organisms such as those included in
Appendix C, Exemptions under Section III-F-8, which have built-in environmental limitations that permit optimum
growth in the large-scale setting but limited survival without adverse consequences in the environment. BL1-
Large Scale is recommended for large-scale research or production of viable organisms containing recombinant
or synthetic nucleic acid molecules that require BL1 containment at the laboratory scale and that do not qualify
for Good Large Scale Practice. BL2-Large Scale is recommended for large-scale research or production of
viable organisms containing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules that require BL2 containment at
the laboratory scale. BL3-Large Scale is recommended for large-scale research or production of viable
organisms containing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules that require BL3 containment at the
laboratory scale. No provisions are made for large-scale research or production of viable organisms containing
recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules that require BL4 containment at the laboratory scale. If
necessary, these requirements will be established by NIH on an individual basis.
Appendix K-II. Good Large Scale Practice (GLSP)
Appendix K-II-A. Institutional codes of practice shall be formulated and implemented to assure adequate
control of health and safety matters.
Appendix K-II-B. Written instructions and training of personnel shall be provided to assure that cultures of
viable organisms containing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules are handled prudently and that the
work place is kept clean and orderly.
Appendix K-II-C. In the interest of good personal hygiene, facilities (e.g., hand washing sink, shower, changing
room) and protective clothing (e.g., uniforms, laboratory coats) shall be provided that are appropriate for the risk
of exposure to viable organisms containing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules. Eating, drinking,
smoking, applying cosmetics, and mouth pipetting shall be prohibited in the work area.
Appendix K-II-D. Cultures of viable organisms containing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules shall
be handled in facilities intended to safeguard health during work with microorganisms that do not require
containment.

accordance with applicable governmental environmental regulations.
Appendix K-II-F. Addition of materials to a system, sample collection, transfer of culture fluids within/between
systems, and processing of culture fluids shall be conducted in a manner that maintains employee's exposure to
viable organisms containing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules at a level that does not adversely
affect the health and safety of employees.

synthetic nucleic acid molecules are immediately reported to the Laboratory Director. Medical evaluation,
surveillance, and treatment are provided as appropriate and written records are maintained.
Appendix K-III-B. Cultures of viable organisms containing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules
shall be handled in a closed system (e.g., closed vessel used for the propagation and growth of cultures) or
other primary containment equipment (e.g., biological safety cabinet containing a centrifuge used to process
culture fluids) which is designed to reduce the potential for escape of viable organisms. Volumes less than 10
liters may be handled outside of a closed system or other primary containment equipment provided all physical
containment requirements specified in Appendix G-II-A, Physical Containment Levels--Biosafety Level 1, are
met.
Appendix K-III-C. Culture fluids (except as allowed in Appendix K-III-D) shall not be removed from a closed
system or other primary containment equipment unless the viable organisms containing recombinant or
synthetic nucleic acid molecules have been inactivated by a validated inactivation procedure. A validated
inactivation procedure is one which has been demonstrated to be effective using the organism that will serve as
the host for propagating the recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules. Culture fluids that contain viable
organisms or viral vectors intended as final product may be removed from the primary containment equipment
by way of closed systems for sample analysis, further processing or final fill.
Appendix K-III-D. Sample collection from a closed system, the addition of materials to a closed system, and
the transfer of culture fluids from one closed system to another shall be conducted in a manner which minimizes
the release of aerosols or contamination of exposed surfaces.
Appendix K-III-E. Exhaust gases removed from a closed system or other primary containment equipment shall
be treated by filters which have efficiencies equivalent to high efficiency particulate air/HEPA filters or by other
equivalent procedures (e.g., incineration) to minimize the release of viable organisms containing recombinant or
synthetic nucleic acid molecules to the environment.
Appendix K-III-F. A closed system or other primary containment equipment that has contained viable
organisms containing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules shall not be opened for maintenance or
other purposes unless it has been sterilized by a validated sterilization procedure except when the culture fluids
contain viable organisms or vectors intended as final product as described in Appendix K-III-C above. A
validated sterilization procedure is one which has been demonstrated to be effective using the organism that will
serve as the host for propagating the recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules.
Appendix K-III-G. Emergency plans required by Sections IV-B-2-b-(6), Institutional Biosafety Committee, and
IV-B-3-c-(3), Biological Safety Officer, shall include methods and procedures for handling large losses of culture
on an emergency basis.
Appendix K-IV. Biosafety Level 2 (BL2) - Large Scale
Appendix K-IV-A. Spills and accidents which result in overt exposures to organisms containing recombinant or
synthetic nucleic acid molecules are immediately reported to the Biological Safety Officer, Institutional Biosafety
Committee, NIH OSP, and other appropriate authorities (if applicable). Reports to NIH OSP shall be sent to the
Office of Science Policy, National Institutes of Health, preferably by e-mail to: NIHGuidelines@od.nih.gov;
additional contact information is also available here and on the OSP website (www.osp.od.nih.gov). Medical 
Page 93 - NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (April 2016)
evaluation, surveillance, and treatment are provided as appropriate and written records are maintained.
Appendix K-IV-B. Cultures of viable organisms containing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules
shall be handled in a closed system (e.g., closed vessel used for the propagation and growth of cultures) or
other primary containment equipment (e.g., Class III biological safety cabinet containing a centrifuge used to
process culture fluids) which is designed to prevent the escape of viable organisms. Volumes less than 10 liters
may be handled outside of a closed system or other primary containment equipment provided all physical
containment requirements specified in Appendix G-II-B, Physical Containment Levels--Biosafety Level 2, are
met.
Appendix K-IV-C. Culture fluids (except as allowed in Appendix K-IV-D) shall not be removed from a closed
system or other primary containment equipment unless the viable organisms containing recombinant or
synthetic nucleic acid molecules have been inactivated by a validated inactivation procedure. A validated
inactivation procedure is one which has been demonstrated to be effective using the organism that will serve as
the host for propagating the recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules. Culture fluids that contain viable
organisms or viral vectors intended as final product may be removed from the primary containment equipment
by way of closed systems for sample analysis, further processing or final fill.
Appendix K-IV-D. Sample collection from a closed system, the addition of materials to a closed system, and
the transfer of cultures fluids from one closed system to another shall be conducted in a manner which prevents
the release of aerosols or contamination of exposed surfaces.
Appendix K-IV-E. Exhaust gases removed from a closed system or other primary containment equipment shall
be treated by filters which have efficiencies equivalent to high efficiency particulate air/HEPA filters or by other
equivalent procedures (e.g., incineration) to prevent the release of viable organisms containing recombinant or
synthetic nucleic acid molecules to the environment.
Appendix K-IV-F. A closed system or other primary containment equipment that has contained viable
organisms containing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules shall not be opened for maintenance or
other purposes unless it has been sterilized by a validated sterilization procedure except when the culture fluids
contain viable organisms or vectors intended as final product as described in Appendix K-IV-C above. A
validated sterilization procedure is one which has been demonstrated to be effective using the organisms that
will serve as the host for propagating the recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules.
Appendix K-IV-G. Rotating seals and other mechanical devices directly associated with a closed system used
for the propagation and growth of viable organisms containing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules
shall be designed to prevent leakage or shall be fully enclosed in ventilated housings that are exhausted through
filters which have efficiencies equivalent to high efficiency particulate air/HEPA filters or through other equivalent
treatment devices.

Appendix K-VI. Footnotes of Appendix K
Appendix K-VI-A. This table is derived from the text in Appendices G (Physical Containment) and K and is not
to be used in lieu of Appendices G and K.
Appendix K-VI-B. The criteria in this grid address only the biological hazards associated with organisms
containing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid. Other hazards accompanying the large-scale cultivation of
such organisms (e.g., toxic properties of products; physical, mechanical, and chemical aspects of downstream
processing) are not addressed and shall be considered separately, albeit in conjunction with this grid.
Appendix K-VII. Definitions to Accompany Containment Grid and Appendix K
Appendix K-VII-A. Accidental Release. An accidental release is the unintentional discharge of a
microbiological agent (i.e., microorganism or virus) or eukaryotic cell due to a failure in the containment system.
Appendix K-VII-B. Biological Barrier. A biological barrier is an impediment (naturally occurring or introduced)
to the infectivity and/or survival of a microbiological agent or eukaryotic cell once it has been released into the
environment.
Appendix K-VII-C. Closed System. A closed system is one in which by its design and proper operation,
prevents release of a microbiological agent or eukaryotic cell contained therein.
Appendix K-VII-D. Containment. Containment is the confinement of a microbiological agent or eukaryotic cell
that is being cultured, stored, manipulated, transported, or destroyed in order to prevent or limit its contact with
people and/or the environment. Methods used to achieve this include: physical and biological barriers and
inactivation using physical or chemical means.
Appendix K-VII-E. De minimis Release. De minimis release is the release of: (i) viable microbiological
agents or eukaryotic cells that does not result in the establishment of disease in healthy people, plants, or
animals; or (ii) in uncontrolled proliferation of any microbiological agents or eukaryotic cells.
Appendix K-VII-F. Disinfection. Disinfection is a process by which viable microbiological agents or eukaryotic
cells are reduced to a level unlikely to produce disease in healthy people, plants, or animals.
Appendix K-VII-G. Good Large Scale Practice Organism. For an organism to qualify for Good Large Scale
Practice consideration, it must meet the following criteria [Reference: Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development, Recombinant DNA Safety Considerations, 1987, p. 34-35]: (i) the host organism should be
non-pathogenic, should not contain adventitious agents and should have an extended history of safe large-scale
use or have built-in environmental limitations that permit optimum growth in the large-scale setting but limited
survival without adverse consequences in the environment; (ii) the recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid
molecule-engineered organism should be non-pathogenic, should be as safe in the large-scale setting as the
host organism, and without adverse consequences in the environment; and (iii) the vector/insert should be well
characterized and free from known harmful sequences; should be limited in size as much as possible to the
DNA required to perform the intended function; should not increase the stability of the construct in the
environment unless that is a requirement of the intended function; should be poorly mobilizable; and should not
transfer any resistance markers to microorganisms unknown to acquire them naturally if such acquisition could
compromise the use of a drug to control disease agents in human or veterinary medicine or agriculture.
Appendix K-VII-H. Inactivation. Inactivation is any process that destroys the ability of a specific
microbiological agent or eukaryotic cell to self-replicate.
Appendix K-VII-I. Incidental Release. An incidental release is the discharge of a microbiological agent or
eukaryotic cell from a containment system that is expected when the system is appropriately designed and
properly operated and maintained.
Appendix K-VII-J. Minimization. Minimization is the design and operation of containment systems in order
that any incidental release is a de minimis release.
Appendix K-VII-K. Pathogen. A pathogen is any microbiological agent or eukaryotic cell containing sufficient 
Page 99 - NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (April 2016)
genetic information, which upon expression of such information, is capable of producing disease in healthy
people, plants, or animals.
Appendix K-VII-L. Physical Barrier. A physical barrier is considered any equipment, facilities, or devices
(e.g., fermentors, factories, filters, thermal oxidizers) which are designed to achieve containment.
Appendix K-VII-M. Release. Release is the discharge of a microbiological agent or eukaryotic cell from a
containment system. Discharges can be incidental or accidental. Incidental releases are de minimis in nature;
accidental releases may be de minimis in nature.

APPENDIX L. GENE THERAPY POLICY CONFERENCES (GTPCS)
In order to enhance the depth and value of public discussion relevant to scientific, safety, social, and ethical
implications of gene therapy research, the NIH Director will convene GTPCs at regular intervals. As
appropriate, the NIH Director may convene a GTPC in conjunction with a RAC meeting. GTPCs will be
administered by NIH OSP. Conference participation will not involve a standing committee membership but
rather will offer the unique advantage of assembling numerous participants who possess significant scientific,
ethical, and legal expertise and/or interest that is directly applicable to a specific gene therapy research issue.
At least one member of RAC will serve as Co-chair of each GTPC and report the findings of each GTPC to RAC
at its next scheduled meeting. The RAC representative for each GTPC will be chosen based on the
participant’s area of expertise relative to the specific gene therapy research issue to be discussed. All RAC
members will be invited to attend GTPCs. GTPCs will have representation from other Federal agencies,
including FDA and OHRP. GTPCs will focus on broad overarching policy and scientific issues related to gene
therapy research. Proposals for GTPC topics may be submitted by members of RAC, representatives of
academia, industry, patient and consumer advocacy organizations, other Federal agencies, professional
scientific societies, and the general public. GTPC topics will not be limited to discussion of human applications
of gene therapy research, i.e., they may include basic research on the use of novel gene delivery vehicles, or
novel applications of human gene transfer. The RAC, with the Director’s approval, will have the primary
responsibility for planning GTPC agendas. GTPC findings will be transmitted to the NIH Director and will be
made publicly available. The NIH Director anticipates that this public policy forum will serve as a model for
interagency communication and collaboration, concentrated expert discussion of novel scientific issues and their
potential societal implications, and enhanced opportunity for public discussion of specific issues and potential
impact of such applications on human health and the environment.
***********************************************************************************************************************
APPENDIX M. POINTS TO CONSIDER IN THE DESIGN AND SUBMISSION OF PROTOCOLS FOR THE
TRANSFER OF RECOMBINANT OR SYNTHETIC NUCLEIC ACID MOLECULES INTO ONE OR MORE
HUMAN RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS (POINTS TO CONSIDER)
Appendix M applies to research conducted at or sponsored by an institution that receives any support for
recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule research from NIH. Researchers not covered by the NIH
Guidelines are encouraged to use Appendix M (see Section I-C, General Applicability).
The acceptability of human somatic cell gene transfer has been addressed in several public documents as well
as in numerous academic studies. In November 1982, the President's Commission for the Study of Ethical
Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research published a report, Splicing Life, which resulted
from a two-year process of public deliberation and hearings. Upon release of that report, a U.S. House of
Representatives subcommittee held three days of public hearings with witnesses from a wide range of fields
from the biomedical and social sciences to theology, philosophy, and law. In December 1984, the Office of
Technology Assessment released a background paper, Human Gene Therapy, which concluded that civic,
religious, scientific, and medical groups have all accepted, in principle, the appropriateness of gene transfer of
somatic cells in humans for specific genetic diseases. Somatic cell gene transfer is seen as an extension of
present methods that might be preferable to other technologies. In light of this public support, the NIH is
prepared to consider proposals for somatic cell gene transfer.
Page 100 - NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (April 2016)
The NIH will not at present entertain proposals for germ line alterations but will consider proposals involving
somatic cell gene transfer. The purpose of somatic cell gene transfer is to treat an individual patient, e.g., by
inserting a properly functioning gene into the subject's somatic cells. Germ line alteration involves a specific
attempt to introduce genetic changes into the germ (reproductive) cells of an individual, with the aim of changing
the set of genes passed on to the individual's offspring.
The NIH continues to explore the issues raised by the potential of in utero gene transfer clinical research.
However, the NIH concludes that, at present, it is premature to undertake any in utero gene transfer clinical trial.
Significant additional preclinical and clinical studies addressing vector transduction efficacy, biodistribution, and
toxicity are required before a human in utero gene transfer protocol can proceed. In addition, a more thorough
understanding of the development of human organ systems, such as the immune and nervous systems, is
needed to better define the potential efficacy and risks of human in utero gene transfer. Prerequisites for
considering any specific human in utero gene transfer procedure include an understanding of the
pathophysiology of the candidate disease and a demonstrable advantage to the in utero approach. Once the
above criteria are met, the NIH would be willing to consider well rationalized human in utero gene transfer
clinical trials.
Research proposals involving the deliberate transfer of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules, or DNA
or RNA derived from such nucleic acid molecules, into one or more human subjects (human gene transfer) will
be considered through a registration process involving the NIH, oversight bodies involved in the review at an
initial site(s), and regulatory authorities, when appropriate. Investigators shall submit the relevant information on
the proposed human gene transfer experiment to the oversight bodies involved in the review at an initial site(s)
and then to the NIH. The format of the submission is described in Appendix M-I-A, Requirements for Protocol
Submission. Submission to the NIH OSP shall be for registration purposes and will ensure continued public
access to relevant human gene transfer information conducted in compliance with the NIH Guidelines.
Public RAC review and discussion of a human gene transfer experiment will be initiated in two exceptional
circumstances: (1) Following a request for public RAC review from one or more oversight bodies involved in the
review at an initial site(s), the NIH concurs that (a) the individual protocol would significantly benefit from RAC
review and (b) that the submission meets one or more of the following NIH RAC review criteria: i) the protocol
uses a new vector, genetic material, or delivery methodology that represents a first-in-human experience, thus
presenting an unknown risk; ii) the protocol relies on preclinical safety data that were obtained using a new
preclinical model system of unknown and unconfirmed value; or iii) the proposed vector, gene construct, or
method of delivery is associated with possible toxicities that are not widely known and that may render it difficult
for oversight bodies involved in the review at an initial site(s) to evaluate the protocol rigorously. However, if
one or more oversight bodies involved in the review at an initial site(s) requests public RAC review, but the NIH
does not concur that (a) the individual protocol would significantly benefit from RAC review and (b) that the
submission meets one or more of the RAC review criteria (listed in i, ii, or iii), then the NIH OSP will inform,
within 10 working days, the requesting and other oversight bodies involved in the review at an initial site(s) that
public RAC review is not warranted. (2) The NIH Director, in consultation (if needed) with appropriate regulatory
authorities, determines that the submission: (a) meets one or more of the NIH RAC review criteria (listed in i, ii,
or iii) and that public RAC review and discussion would provide a clear and obvious benefit to the scientific
community or the public; or (b) raises significant scientific, societal, or ethical concerns.
If it is determined that a human gene transfer trial will undergo public RAC review, the NIH will immediately
notify the Principal Investigator. Recommendations following public review on a specific human gene transfer
experiment shall be forwarded to the Principal Investigator, oversight bodies involved in the review at an initial
site(s), and regulatory authorities, as appropriate. Relevant documentation will be included in the material for
the RAC meeting at which the human gene transfer trial is scheduled to be discussed. RAC meetings will be
open to the public except where trade secrets and proprietary information are reviewed (see Section IV-D-5,
Protection of Proprietary Data – Voluntary Compliance). Information provided in response to Appendix M
should not contain any proprietary data or trade secrets, enabling all aspects of the review to be open to the
public.
Appendix M-I. Requirements for Protocol Submission, Review, and Reporting – Human Gene Transfer
Experiments
Appendix M-I-A. Requirements for Protocol Submission
The following documentation must be submitted according to institutional policy, to the appropriate oversight 
Page 101 - NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (April 2016)
bodies involved in the review at an initial site(s) and subsequently in electronic form to the NIH OSP:
1. A scientific abstract.
2. The proposed clinical protocol, including tables, figures, and any relevant publications.
3. Summary of preclinical studies conducted in support of the proposed clinical trial or reference to the
specific section of the protocol providing this information.
4. A description of the product:
a. Describe the derivation of the delivery vector system including the source (e.g., viral, bacterial,
or plasmid vector); and modifications (e.g., deletions to attenuate or self-inactivate,
encapsulation in any synthetic complex, changes to tropisms, etc.). Please reference any
previous clinical experience with this vector or similar vectors.
b. Describe the genetic content of the transgene or nucleic acid delivered including the species
source of the sequence and whether any modifications have been made (e.g. mutations,
deletions, and truncations). What are the regulatory elements contained in the construct?
c. Describe any other material to be used in preparation of the agent (vector and transgene) that
will be administered to the human research subject (e.g., helper virus, packaging cell line,
carrier particles).
d. Describe the methods for replication-competent virus testing, if applicable.
e. Describe the intended ex vivo or in vivo target cells and transduction efficiency.
f. Describe the gene transfer agent delivery method.
5. The proposed informed consent document(s).
6. Specifically for submission to the NIH OSP, the Principal Investigator shall provide additional
documentation originating from oversight bodies involved in the review at an initial site(s) regarding their
assessment of whether public RAC review is warranted. In the event that review is requested, a
justification that one or more of the NIH RAC review criteria (see Section III-C-1) are met shall be
included.
Note: Any application submitted shall not contain any document that is designated as ‘confidential’ in its
entirety. In the event that a determination has been made that a specific portion of a document should be
considered proprietary or trade secret, each specific portion shall be clearly identified as such. In the event that
a specific portion of the submission is identified to be proprietary or trade secret, the submission to the NIH OSP
must contain a letter that: (1) clearly indicates what select portions of the application contain information
considered as proprietary or trade secret, and (2) provides justification as to why this information is considered
to be proprietary or trade secret. The justification must be able to demonstrate with specificity how release of
that information will reveal a trade secret or will result in substantial competitive harm.
Appendix M-I-B. Selection of Individual Protocols for Public RAC Review and Discussion
As part of the NIH protocol registration process, documentation originating from all oversight bodies involved in
the review at an initial site(s) regarding their assessment of whether public RAC review is warranted must
accompany the Principal Investigator’s submission to the NIH. If no oversight body involved in the review at an
initial site(s) requests public RAC review, then the required documentation to register the protocol (see
Appendix M-I-A) shall be submitted to the NIH OSP at any time, but not less than 10 working days prior to the
anticipated date of enrollment of the first subject (see definition of enrollment in Section I-E-7). This information
shall be provided in electronic form to the Office of Science Policy, National Institutes of Health, preferably by email to: HGTprotocols@mail.nih.gov; additional contact information is also available here and on the OSP
website (www.osp.od.nih.gov). An acknowledgement that the protocol registration process is complete will
occur within the 10 working days period prior to the anticipated date of enrollment. Final IBC approval may
then be granted.
If one or more oversight bodies involved in the review at an initial site(s) requests public RAC review, but the
NIH does not concur that (a) the individual protocol would significantly benefit from RAC review and (b) that the
submission meets one or more of the RAC review criteria, the NIH OSP will notify the Principal Investigator,
oversight bodies involved in the review at an initial site(s), and regulatory authorities, as appropriate, that public
RAC review is not warranted. An acknowledgement that the protocol registration process is complete will
accompany this decision. Final IBC approval may then be granted.
If an oversight body involved in the review at an initial site(s) determines that: (1) a protocol submission would
significantly benefit from public RAC review and discussion and (2) that one or more of the following NIH RAC
review criteria are met: (i) the protocol uses a new vector, genetic material, or delivery methodology that
represents a first-in-human experience, thus presenting an unknown risk; or (ii) the protocol relies on preclinical 
Page 102 - NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (April 2016)
safety data that were obtained using a new preclinical model system of unknown and unconfirmed value; or (iii)
the proposed vector, gene construct, or method of delivery is associated with possible toxicities that are not
widely known and that may render it difficult for oversight and federal regulatory bodies to evaluate the protocol
rigorously, and is therefore requesting RAC review and public discussion. The Principal Investigator shall then
submit the documentation as outlined in Appendix M-I-A at least 8 weeks prior to the next scheduled meeting in
order to be reviewed at that RAC meeting. The submission shall include documentation originating from
oversight bodies involved in the review at an initial site(s) regarding their assessment of whether public RAC
review is warranted and that one or both have justified their request according the NIH RAC review criteria listed
above. The submission shall be provided to the NIH in electronic form to the Office of Science Policy, National
Institutes of Health, preferably by e-mail to: HGTprotocols@mail.nih.gov; additional contact information is also
available here and on the OSP website (www.osp.od.nih.gov). If the NIH concurs that (a) the individual protocol
would significantly benefit from RAC review and (b) that the submission meets one or more of the NIH RAC
review criteria, the protocol will undergo public RAC review and discussion.
Even if an oversight body involved in the review at an initial site(s) does not request public RAC review, the NIH
Director, after consultation (if needed) with appropriate regulatory authorities, may initiate public RAC review if
(a) the protocol has one or more of the characteristics listed above (i, ii, or iii) and public RAC review and
discussion would provide a clear and obvious benefit to the scientific community or public; or (b) the protocol
otherwise raises significant scientific, societal, or ethical concerns. If a protocol is to undergo RAC public
discussion a complete human gene transfer protocol package must be submitted at least 8 weeks before a
scheduled RAC meeting to be reviewed at that upcoming meeting.
After a human gene transfer experiment is publicly reviewed by the full RAC at a regularly scheduled meeting,
the NIH OSP will send a letter summarizing the RAC’s comments and recommendations (if any) regarding the
protocol to the Principal Investigator(s), oversight bodies involved in the review at an initial site(s), and
regulatory authorities as appropriate. Unless the NIH determines that there are exceptional circumstances, the
NIH will send this letter to the Principal Investigator within 10 working days after the completion of the RAC
meeting at which the experiment was reviewed. Receipt of this letter concludes the protocol registration
process. Final IBC approval may then be granted.
RAC meetings will be open to the public except where trade secrets or confidential commercial information are
reviewed. To enable all aspects of the protocol review process to be open to the public, information provided in
response to Appendix M-I-A should not contain trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information.
Documentation submitted to the NIH OSP shall not be designated as ‘confidential’ in its entirety. In the event
that a determination has been made that a specific portion of a document submitted should be considered as
proprietary or trade secret, each specific portion should be clearly identified as such. The cover letter (attached
to the submitted material) shall: (1) clearly indicate what select portions contain information considered as
proprietary or a trade secret; and (2) provide justification as to why this information is considered to be
proprietary or trade secret. This justification must be able to demonstrate with specificity how release of that
information will reveal a trade secret or will result in substantial competitive harm.

gene transfer product (i.e., there is reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the use of
the product; investigators should not await definitive proof of association before reporting such events); and (2)
any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human research participants
including reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity. The report must be clearly labeled as a
“Safety Report” and must be submitted to the NIH Office of Science Policy (NIH OSP) and to the local
Institutional Biosafety Committee within the timeframes set forth in Appendix M-I-C-4-b.
Principal Investigators should adhere to any other serious adverse event reporting requirements in accordance
with federal regulations, state laws, and local institutional policies and procedures, as applicable.
Principal Investigators may delegate to another party, such as a corporate sponsor, the reporting functions set
forth in Appendix M, with written notification to the NIH OSP of the delegation and of the name(s), address,
telephone and fax numbers of the contact(s). The Principal Investigator is responsible for ensuring that the
reporting requirements are fulfilled and will be held accountable for any reporting lapses.
The three alternative mechanisms for reporting serious adverse events to the NIH OSP are: by e-mail to:
HGTprotocols@mail.nih.gov; by fax to 301-496-9839; or by mail to the Office of Science Policy, National
Institutes of Health, MSC 7985, 6705 Rockledge Drive, Suite 750, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7985 (20817 for
non-USPS mail). 
Page 104 - NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (April 2016)
Appendix M-I-C-4-a. Safety Reporting: Content and Format
The serious adverse event report must include, but need not be limited to: (1) the date of the event; (2)
designation of the report as an initial report or a follow-up report, identification of all safety reports previously
filed for the clinical protocol concerning a similar adverse event, and an analysis of the significance of the
adverse event in light of previous similar reports; (3) clinical site; (4) the Principal Investigator; (5) NIH Protocol
number; (6) FDA’s Investigational New Drug (IND) Application number; (7) vector type , e.g., adenovirus; (8)
vector subtype, e.g., type 5, relevant deletions; (9) gene delivery method, e.g., in vivo, ex vivo transduction; (10)
route of administration, e.g., intratumoral, intravenous; (11) dosing schedule; (12) a complete description of the
event; (13) relevant clinical observations; (14) relevant clinical history; (15) relevant tests that were or are
planned to be conducted; (16) date of any treatment of the event; and (17) the suspected cause of the event.
These items may be reported by using the recommended Adverse Event Reporting Template available on NIH
OSP’s web site at: http://osp.od.nih.gov/office-biotechnology-activities/biomedical-technologyassessment/hgt/gemcris, the FDA MedWatch forms, or other means provided that all of the above elements are
specifically included.
Reports from laboratory animal studies as delineated in Appendix M-I-C-4 must be submitted in a narrative
format.
Appendix M-I-C-4-b. Safety Reporting: Time frames for Expedited Reports
Any serious adverse event that is fatal or life-threatening, that is unexpected, and associated with the use of the
gene transfer product must be reported to the NIH OSP as soon as possible, but not later than 7 calendar days
after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information (i.e., at the same time the event must be reported to the
FDA).
Serious adverse events that are unexpected and associated with the use of the gene transfer product, but are
not fatal or life-threatening, must be reported to the NIH OSP as soon as possible, but not later than 15 calendar
days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information (i.e., at the same time the event must be reported to the
FDA).
Changes in this schedule are permitted only where, under the FDA IND regulations [21 CFR 312(c)(3)], changes
in this reporting schedule have been approved by the FDA and are reflected in the protocol.
If, after further evaluation, an adverse event initially considered not to be associated with the use of the gene
transfer product is subsequently determined to be associated, then the event must be reported to the NIH OSP
within 15 days of the determination.
Relevant additional clinical and laboratory data may become available following the initial serious adverse event
report. Any follow-up information relevant to a serious adverse event must be reported within 15 calendar days
of the sponsor’s receipt of the information. If a serious adverse event occurs after the end of a clinical trial and
is determined to be associated with the use of the gene transfer product, that event shall be reported to the NIH
OSP within 15 calendar days of the determination.
Any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human research participants
including reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity must be reported as soon as possible, but
not later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information (i.e., at the same time the
event must be reported to the FDA).
Appendix M-I-C-5. Confidentiality
Data submitted in accordance with Appendix M-I-C that are claimed to be confidential commercial or trade
secret information must be clearly labeled as such. Prior to making its determination about the confidentiality of
data labeled confidential commercial or trade secret, the NIH will contact the Principal Investigator or delegate to
ascertain the basis for the claim and subsequently will notify the Principal Investigator or delegate of its final
determination regarding the claim.
If NIH determines that the data so labeled are confidential commercial or trade secret and that their public
disclosure would promote an understanding of key scientific or safety issues, the NIH will seek agreement from 
Page 105 - NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (April 2016)
the appropriate party to release such data. Public discussion of scientific and safety issues raised by data
submitted in accordance with Appendix M-I-C is vital to informing both investigators and human subjects about
the safety of gene transfer research.
To protect the privacy of participants in gene transfer research, any serious adverse event or annual reports
submitted to NIH OSP must not contain any information that would identify the human research participants.
Appendix M-I-D. Safety Assessment in Human Gene Transfer Research
A working group of the RAC, the NIH Gene Transfer Safety Assessment Board, with staff support from the NIH
OSP, will: 1) review in closed session as appropriate safety information from gene transfer trials for the purpose
of assessing toxicity and safety data across gene transfer trials; 2) identify significant trends or significant single
events; and 3) report significant findings and aggregated trend data to the RAC. It is expected that this process
will enhance review of new protocols, improve the development, design, and conduct of human gene transfer
trials, promote public understanding and awareness of the safety of human gene transfer research studies, and
inform the decision-making of potential trial participants.
Appendix M-II. Long-Term Follow-Up
To permit evaluation of long-term safety and efficacy of gene transfer, prospective subjects should be informed
that they are expected to cooperate in long-term follow-up that extends beyond the active phase of the study. A
list of persons who can be contacted in the event that questions arise during the follow-up period should be
provided to the investigator. In addition, the investigator should request that subjects continue to provide a
current address and telephone number.
The subjects should be informed that any significant findings resulting from the study will be made known in
a timely manner to them and/or their parent or guardian including new information about the experimental
procedure, the harms and benefits experienced by other individuals involved in the study, and any long-term
effects that have been observed.

APPENDIX P. PHYSICAL AND BIOLOGICAL CONTAINMENT FOR RECOMBINANT OR SYNTHETIC
NUCLEIC ACID MOLECULE RESEARCH INVOLVING PLANTS
Appendix P specifies physical and biological containment conditions and practices suitable to the greenhouse
conduct of experiments involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule-containing plants, plantassociated microorganisms, and small animals. All provisions of the NIH Guidelines apply to plant research
activities with the following modifications:
Appendix P shall supersede Appendix G (Physical Containment) when the research plants are of a size,
number, or have growth requirements that preclude the use of containment conditions described in Appendix G.
The plants covered in Appendix P include but are not limited to mosses, liverworts, macroscopic algae, and
vascular plants including terrestrial crops, forest, and ornamental species.
Plant-associated microorganisms include viroids, virusoids, viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoans, certain small
algae, and microorganisms that have a benign or beneficial association with plants, such as certain Rhizobium
Page 106 - NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (April 2016)
species and microorganisms known to cause plant diseases. The appendix applies to microorganisms which
are being modified with the objective of fostering an association with plants.
Plant-associated small animals include those arthropods that: (i) are in obligate association with plants, (ii) are
plant pests, (iii) are plant pollinators, or (iv) transmit plant disease agents, as well as other small animals such
as nematodes for which tests of biological properties necessitate the use of plants. Microorganisms associated
with such small animals (e.g., pathogens or symbionts) are included.
The Institutional Biosafety Committee shall include at least one individual with expertise in plant, plant pathogen,
or plant pest containment principles when experiments utilizing Appendix P require prior approval by the
Institutional Biosafety Committee.
Appendix P-I. General Plant Biosafety Levels
Appendix P-I-A. The principal purpose of plant containment is to avoid the unintentional transmission of a
recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule-containing plant genome, including nuclear or organelle
hereditary material or release of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule-derived organisms associated
with plants.
Appendix P-I-B. The containment principles are based on the recognition that the organisms that are used
pose no health threat to humans or higher animals (unless deliberately modified for that purpose), and that the
containment conditions minimize the possibility of an unanticipated deleterious effect on organisms and
ecosystems outside of the experimental facility, e.g., the inadvertent spread of a serious pathogen from a
greenhouse to a local agricultural crop or the unintentional introduction and establishment of an organism in a
new ecosystem.
Appendix P-I-C. Four biosafety levels, referred to as Biosafety Level (BL) 1 - Plants (P), BL2-P, BL3-P, and
BL4-P, are established in Appendix P-II, Physical Containment Levels. The selection of containment levels
required for research involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules in plants or associated with
plants is specified in Appendix P-III, Biological Containment Practices. These biosafety levels are described in
Appendix P-II, Physical Containment Levels. This appendix describes greenhouse practices and special
greenhouse facilities for physical containment.
Appendix P-I-D. BL1-P through BL4-P are designed to provide differential levels of biosafety for plants in the
absence or presence of other experimental organisms that contain recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid
molecules. These biosafety levels, in conjunction with biological containment conditions described in Appendix
P-III, Biological Containment Practices, provide flexible approaches to ensure the safe conduct of research.
Appendix P-I-E. For experiments in which plants are grown at the BL1 through BL4 laboratory settings,
containment practices shall be followed as described in Appendix G, Physical Containment. These containment
practices include the use of plant tissue culture rooms, growth chambers within laboratory facilities, or
experiments performed on open benches. Additional biological containment practices should be added by the
Greenhouse Director or Institutional Biosafety Committee as necessary (see Appendix P-III, Biological
Containment Practices), if botanical reproductive structures are produced that have the potential of being
released.

the environment resulting in deleterious consequences to managed or natural ecosystems.
Appendix P-III-A. Biological Containment Practices (Plants)
Appendix P-III-A-1. Effective dissemination of plants by pollen or seed can be prevented by one or more of the
following procedures: (i) cover the reproductive structures to prevent pollen dissemination at flowering and seed
dissemination at maturity; (ii) remove reproductive structures by employing male sterile strains, or harvest the 
Page 116 - NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (April 2016)
plant material prior to the reproductive stage; (iii) ensure that experimental plants flower at a time of year when
cross-fertile plants are not flowering within the normal pollen dispersal range of the experimental plant; or (iv)
ensure that cross-fertile plants are not growing within the known pollen dispersal range of the experimental
plant.
Appendix P-III-B. Biological Containment Practices (Microorganisms)
Appendix P-III-B-1. Effective dissemination of microorganisms beyond the confines of the greenhouse can be
prevented by one or more of the following procedures: (i) confine all operations to injections of microorganisms
or other biological procedures (including genetic manipulation) that limit replication or reproduction of viruses
and microorganisms or sequences derived from microorganisms, and confine these injections to internal plant
parts or adherent plant surfaces; (ii) ensure that organisms, which can serve as hosts or promote the
transmission of the virus or microorganism, are not present within the farthest distance that the airborne virus or
microorganism may be expected to be effectively disseminated; (iii) conduct experiments at a time of year when
plants that can serve as hosts are either not growing or are not susceptible to productive infection; (iv) use
viruses and other microorganisms or their genomes that have known arthropod or animal vectors, in the
absence of such vectors; (v) use microorganisms that have an obligate association with the plant; or (vi) use
microorganisms that are genetically disabled to minimize survival outside of the research facility and whose
natural mode of transmission requires injury of the target organism, or assures that inadvertent release is
unlikely to initiate productive infection of organisms outside of the experimental facility.
Appendix P-III-C. Biological Containment Practices (Macroorganisms)
Appendix P-III-C-1. Effective dissemination of arthropods and other small animals can be prevented by using
one or more of the following procedures: (i) use non-flying, flight-impaired, or sterile arthropods; (ii) use nonmotile or sterile strains of small animals; (iii) conduct experiments at a time of year that precludes the survival of
escaping organisms; (iv) use animals that have an obligate association with a plant that is not present within the
dispersal range of the organism; or (v) prevent the escape of organisms present in run-off water by chemical
treatment or evaporation of run-off water.

Page 128 - NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (April 2016)
and a challenge concentration of 80-120 micrograms per liter. The air sampling rate should be at least 1 cfm
(28.3 liters per minute).
Appendix Q-II-D-2-m. If an air incinerator is used in lieu of the second high efficiency particulate air/HEPA
filter, it shall be biologically challenged to prove all viable test agents are sterilized. The biological challenge
must be minimally 1x108 organisms per cubic foot of airflow through the incinerator. It is universally accepted if
bacterial spores are used to challenge and verify that the equipment is capable of killing spores, then assurance
is provided that all other known agents are inactivated by the parameters established to operate the equipment.
Test spores meeting this criterion are Bacillus subtilis var. niger or Bacillus stearothermophilus. The operating
temperature of the incinerator shall be continuously monitored and recorded during use.
Appendix Q-II-D-2-n. All equipment and floor drains shall be equipped with deep traps (minimally 5 inches).
Floor drains shall be fitted with isolation plugs or fitted with automatic water fill devices.
Appendix Q-II-D-2-o. Each animal area shall contain a foot, elbow, or automatically operated sink for hand
washing. The sink shall be located near the exit door.
Appendix Q-II-D-2-p. Restraining devices for animals may be required to avoid damage to the integrity of the
containment animal facility.
Appendix Q-II-D-2-q. The supply water distribution system shall be fitted with a back-flow preventer or break
tank.
Appendix Q-II-D-2-r. All utilities, liquid and gas services, shall be protected with devices that avoid back-flow.
Appendix Q-II-D-2-s. Sewer and other atmospheric ventilation lines shall be equipped minimally with a single
high efficiency particulate/HEPA filter. Condensate drains from these type housings shall be appropriately
connected to a contaminated or sanitary drain system. The drain position in the housing dictates the
appropriate system to be used.
Appendix Q-III. Footnotes and References for Appendix Q
Appendix Q-III-A. If a recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule is derived from a Class 2 organism
requiring BL2 containment, personnel shall be required to have specific training in handling pathogenic agents
and directed by knowledgeable scientists.
Appendix Q-III-B. Personnel who handle pathogenic and potentially lethal agents shall be required to have
specific training and be supervised by knowledgeable scientists who are experienced in working with these
agents. BL3-N containment also minimizes escape of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid moleculecontaining organisms from exhaust air or waste material from the containment area.
Appendix Q-III-C. Risk Group 4 and restricted microorganisms (see Appendix B, Classification of Human
Etiologic Agents on the Basis of Hazard, and Sections V-G and V-L, Footnotes and References of Sections I
through IV) pose a high level of individual risk for acquiring life-threatening diseases to personnel and/or
animals. To import animal or plant pathogens, special approval must be obtained from U.S. Department of
Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Veterinary Services, National Center for
Import-Export, Products Program, 4700 River Road, Unit 40, Riverdale, MD 20737. Phone: (301) 734-8499;
Fax: (301) 734-8226.
Laboratory staff shall be required to have specific and thorough training in handling extremely hazardous
infectious agents, primary and secondary containment, standard and special practices, and laboratory design
characteristics. The laboratory staff shall be supervised by knowledgeable scientists who are trained and
experienced in working with these agents and in the special containment facilities.
Within work areas of the animal facility, all activities shall be confined to the specially equipped animal rooms or
support areas. The maximum animal containment area and support areas shall have special engineering and
design features to prevent the dissemination of microorganisms into the environment via exhaust air or waste
disposal.

Appendix Q-III-D. Other research with non-laboratory animals, which may not appropriately be conducted
under conditions described in Appendix Q, may be conducted safely by applying practices routinely used for
controlled culture of these biota. In aquatic systems, for example, BL1 equivalent conditions could be met by
utilizing growth tanks that provide adequate physical means to avoid the escape of the aquatic species, its
gametes, and introduced exogenous genetic material. A mechanism shall be provided to ensure that neither the
organisms nor their gametes can escape into the supply or discharge system of the rearing container (e.g., tank,
aquarium, etc.) Acceptable barriers include appropriate filtration, irradiation, heat treatment, chemical treatment,
etc. Moreover, the top of the rearing container shall be covered to avoid escape of the organism and its
gametes. In the event of tank rupture, leakage, or overflow, the construction of the room containing these tanks
should prevent the organisms and gametes from entering the building's drains before the organism and its
gametes have been inactivated.
Other types of non-laboratory animals (e.g., nematodes, arthropods, and certain forms of smaller animals) may
be accommodated by using the appropriate BL1 through BL4 or BL1-P through BL4-P containment practices
and procedures as specified in Appendices G and P.
