Preface
This translation is part of the research project International
Constitutional Law (ICL: www.verfassungsvergleich.de). All
amendments up to and including the 60th Amendment of 23rd Dec
2014 have been translated and included into a consolidated edition.
There have been no more amendments until today (6th July 2016).
This is not an official government document. The full text of the
most recent version is available as a free download on the Internet:
www.ssrn.com/no=1501131.
Following the ICL translation standards, some terms are
translated specifically to prepare the text for search engines, e.g.,
'Länder' as 'States', 'Bundestag' as 'House of Representatives',
'Bundesrat' as 'Senate', 'Bundesbank' as 'Federal Bank'. This does in
no way imply any similarity of those institutions with the
respective U.S. institutions. German terms have been added in
square brackets to clarify the matter and to distinguish references
to single States [Länder] from the generic term 'state' (i.e.,
Federation and/or States). Generally, headings and explanations in
square brackets are not part of the official text, but additions for the
purpose of the present edition. The same is true of footnotes.
The translation uses abbreviated cross references for articles,
paragraphs and sentences, writing "Article 10 II 2" instead of
"Article 10, Paragraph 2, Sentence 2". While such cross references
contain roman numbers for paragraphs, within the text of German
statutes those same paragraphs are commonly numbered with
ordinary digits in round brackets. Accordingly, you will have to
look for the section of Article 10 that starts with "(2)" and then go to
the second sentence. Literal translation has been used for the brief
provisions of Basic Rights (Chapter I). The lengthy text of all other
chapters, however, has been translated freely to make it more
readable.
My gratitude for help with the text edition, translation, and
commentary goes to prior and present research assistants at the
Chair for Constitutional Law, Legal Philosophy, and Constitutional
History.

Table of Amendments
7 This is the date of the actual unification act and, therefore, the starting
point for material validity of the new articles (cf. Pmbl.). However, the
unification treaty and therefore the amendment was formally in force
since 29.9.90.
8 This amendment was part of the unification treaty, therefore included in
Part II of the Federal Law Gazette (Bundesgesetzblatt), i.e., among the
international treaties.
9 The amendment, by special provision, came into force at the end of the
day when the 14th German House of Representatives [Bundestag]
convened for the first time, i.e., on 26th October 1998.

The Basic Law (Grundgesetz)
10 The amendment was tied to the Treaty of Lisbon, therefore entering into
force together with that instrument.
Introduction
The Basic Law [Grundgesetz], Germany's Constitution, remains a
central point of reference in International Constitutional Law. The
instrument has been amended 60 times during the more than 60
years of its application, even surviving groundbreaking political
changes like the reunification of West and East Germany. After two
failed attempts at a democratic Constitution in Germany (1848,
1919), this third one turned out to be a success. Lessons learned
from the period of Nazi rule led to a number of peculiarities much
discussed in comparative studies: the figurehead presidency (cf.
Art. 58 GG), the eternal guarantee of human dignity and
democracy (Art. 79 III GG), the constructive vote of no confidence
(Art. 67 GG), the (difficult) procedure for prohibiting political
parties (Art. 21 II GG), and the complete lack of direct democratic
elements on the federal level (cf. Art. 29 II GG). The principles for
the professional civil service (Art. 33 V GG) and the rules regarding
the relationship between state and church (Art. 140 GG) are
reaching back to prior constitutional traditions. Other provisions
are singular results of political controversies: the right to legitimate
resistance (Art. 20 IV GG), the individual right to conscientious
objection (Art. 4 III GG), and Parliament's indirect participation in
the Government's European Union activity (Art. 23 GG). Due to the
position and jurisdiction of the Federal Constitutional Court (Art.
93 GG), the supremacy of the constitution is an all-pervading
element in German law: by acknowledging a general freedom of
action [Allgemeine Handlungsfreiheit] (Art. 2 I GG), by the
comprehensive individual complaint procedure (Art. 93 I Number
4a GG), by the duty of the Constitutional Court to deal with every
complaint, and by the indirect control over institutional settings
achieved through claims based on basic rights.
What is so special about the German Constitution and its
success? The answer can be divided into four parts: the draft and
adoption procedure (1), the transformations of sovereignty (2),
constitutionalization of the legal system by the case law of the
Federal Constitutional Court (3), and the reunification by inclusion
of the five reestablished East German States plus East Berlin (4).
Notwithstanding all indicators of success, there are also problems
with the current state of the German Constitution (5).
1. Draft and Adoption
a) Procedure
The Basic Law was drafted by 65 delegates from State Parliaments
[Länder] assembled as 'Parliamentary Council' [Parlamentarischer
Rat] in Bonn (Sep 1948 to May 1949). This drafting procedure had
been initiated and closely watched by three of the four allied
powers then governing the military occupation zones in Germany,
namely: France, Britain, and the United States of America (Western
Allies). The draft was then adopted as the new German
Constitution by the majority of West German State Parliaments.
Initially, the Western Allies, against the protest of the Soviet
Union, outlined the conditions for a West German State in the
Frankfurt Documents during the second phase of the London
Conference (April to June 1948). They presented these Documents
to the eleven Prime Ministers of the West German States [Länder]
(July 1948) thereby authorizing a Constitutional Convention. The
Prime Ministers declared this to be a provisional measure
[Provisorium] pending German unification [Koblenzer Beschlüsse].
They then sent their representatives to Herrenchiemsee, a
picturesque island in Bavaria, in order to adopt a preliminary draft
of the constitution (Aug 1948) [Herrenchiemseer Entwurf]. Many of
the Basic Law's defining features were designed by the small group
of bureaucrats and legal experts in Herrenchiemsee: the federal
structure, the two-chamber parliament, the parliamentary rather
than presidential form of government, the figurehead presidency,
the eternal guarantees for human dignity and democracy, and the
complete lack of direct democratic elements on the federal level.
The Parliamentary Council [Parlamentarischer Rat] consisting
of 65 full members elected by the Western State Parliaments, plus 5
advisory members from West Berlin, started its deliberation in
Bonn (Sep 1948), the small city later to become the capital of West
Germany. Exactly four years after the end of World War II, the
Council adopted the draft of the Basic Law (8 May 1949). The
Western Allies – who had united their occupation government
within a West German Trizone (April 1948) and were actively
promoting its recovery within the Marshall plan (European
Recovery Program, ERP) – immediately approved this draft (12
May 1949). The constitution did not provide for a public
referendum on its adoption. The only requirement was the support
by at least two thirds of the State Parliaments (Art. 144 I GG). Only
in Bavaria did the draft not achieve this support. The
Parliamentary Council therefore formally declared the Basic Law to
16 The Basic Law (Grundgesetz)
be adopted (Art. 145 I GG) and it entered into force on 24 May
1949.
b) No Constitutional Convention
According to this procedure, Germany did not have a
Constitutional Convention publicly elected for the purpose of
drafting a constitution. The result was not submitted to popular
referendum before entering into force. Furthermore, the allied
powers interfered with the drafting by establishing a number of
preconditions in the Frankfurt Documents and influencing the
deliberation by frequent interventions. Therefore, Germany's
Constitution lacked the direct democratic legitimation normally
expected for such a foundational document. The result set into
force in 1949 cannot easily be understood as an expression of the
German People's constitution making power (pouvoir constitutant).
c) Only a "Basic Law"
The ominous title "Basic Law" expresses some of the preliminary
and undecided atmosphere of the event. The document was not
intended as a permanent constitution for Germany. On the
contrary, the original Preamble of 1949 stressed that not all
Germans were allowed to participate in this process of constitution
making and, therefore, "[t]he entire German People remains
obliged to fulfill the unity and freedom of Germany in free
self-determination." A peace treaty, national union, and a real
constitution adopted in all parts of Germany were supposedly still
an option. At the beginning of the split between the Western and
the Eastern Bloc, the upcoming 50 years of Germany's Cold War
separation had not yet been foreseen. On the contrary. The German
public did not want to legally entrench the de facto divide between
East and West playing out in the middle of the country. The
currency reform with the new 'Deutschmark' was already a burden
for German unity. It was issued under the Western Allies'
occupation (20 June 1948), but popularized by West German
politicians who tied it to abolishing economic controls. In the East
German sector occupied by the Soviet Union, the currency reform
in the West was hastily countered by the 'Eastern Mark'. General
sympathy during this time tended towards a unified Germany – an
inspiration also expressed in the solidarity for Berlin during the
Berlin blockade (June 1948 to May 1949).
Introduction 17
d) Democratic Support
There can be no doubt, however, that the German people after 12
years of Nazi rule and the devastation of holocaust and war was
most willing to return into the fold of Western democracies. The
Basic Law is not a mere imposition of foreign powers. It draws on
two revolutionary constitutions for inspiration: the Constitution of
1849 [Paulskirchenverfassung] and the Constitution of 1919
[Weimarer Reichsverfassung]. Working like legal templates, these
earlier democratic Constitutions already met most of the criteria
established by the Western Allies for the Basic Law – they
acknowledged human rights, the rule of law, federalism, and
democracy.
2. Transformations of Sovereignty
a) Military Occupation
The original Constitution was still adopted under restrictions of
national sovereignty by military occupation. Soon, however, Cold
War politics resulted in the rearmament of Germany. This policy
first led to the formal end of occupation in West Germany and to
opening up the Constitution for a possible membership in the
European Defense Community (4th Amendment, 26 March 1954).
When the Community did not materialize due to French
parliamentary opposition and West Germany acceded to NATO
instead (9 May 1955), the Germany Treaty [Deutschlandvertrag]
with the Western Allies reestablished most sovereignty rights and
introduced the much opposed general conscription for male
citizens aged 18 to 45 (7th Amendment, 19 March 1956).
b) National Sovereignty
As an additional step requested by the Western Allies, the First
Grand Coalition adopted the even more controversial Emergency
and Defence Provisions [Notstandsverfassung] (17th Amendment,
24 June 1968) in order to overcome the remaining control rights of
the Western Allies. This amendment introduced the option of
emergency legislation and, among other basic rights restrictions,
allowed for wire tapping by German authorities, formerly reserved
to the Western Allies. While recourse to the courts is the guiding
principle of the Basic Law (Art. 19 IV GG), wire tapping measures
are only supervised by a special commission [G10-Kommission] in
the House of Representatives [Bundestag] (Art. 10 II GG). As a
18 The Basic Law (Grundgesetz)
measure of compensation, a new fundamental right to legitimate
resistance (Art. 20 IV GG) was included into the amendment.
c) European Integration
Due to the original integration provision of the Basic Law (Art. 24
GG), there was never a doubt about West Germany's competence to
become a member in international and supranational
organizations. Full membership in the Council of Europe (1951)
including the European Convention on Human Rights and its
diverse protocols (1952-2002), the accession to NATO (1955), and
the diverse steps of integration leading to the European Union
(Coal and Steel Community 1952, Treaties of Rome 1957, Single
European Act 1986, Maastricht Treaty 1992) are evidence of this
capacity. The more controversial steps of this integration process
were accompanied by amendments to the Basic Law and confirmed
by decisions of the Federal Constitutional Court. The Maastricht
Treaty, for example, led to a new provision on Parliament's indirect
participation in European Union policy (Art. 23 GG, 38th
Amendment, 21 Dec 1992; BVerfGE 89, 155 – Maastricht, 12 Oct
1993). It was later extended by a paragraph for the Treaty of Lisbon
(Art. 23 Ia GG, 53rd Amendment, 8 Oct 2008; BVerfGE 123, 267 –
Lisbon, 30 June 2009).
3. Constitutionalization
The Federal Constitutional Court [Bundesverfassungsgericht]
submits all of German law to a detailed test of constitutionality. The
remarkable scope and intensity of this control is called
'constitutionalization'. Under this label, the protection of
fundamental rights is extended to all activities (a), even in civil law
cases (b), against infringements not only by the state, but also by
private parties (c), and it encompasses new rights not foreseen in
the constitution (d).
a) The Elfes Case
The court started the constitutionalization of German law with the
constitutional complaint of Wilhelm Elfes, an opposition politician
whose participation in a congress abroad was obstructed by the
government's refusal to renew his passport (BVerfGE 6, 32 – Elfes,
16 Jan 1957). The court had to decide whether the fundamental
rights of the Basic Law extended beyond the explicit guarantees of
the Constitution. In acknowledging a general freedom of action
[Allgemeine Handlungsfreiheit] (Art. 2 I GG), the court designed
Introduction 19
an all purpose protection under the new Constitution. It also
allowed the petitioner to challenge legal restrictions due to formal
as well as material errors.
b) The Lüth Case
In the case of Erich Lüth, a Hamburg politician who had publicly
called for the boycott of a film by a director who was notorious as a
Nazi film maker, the court had to decide about the impact of
fundamental rights on the private law (BVerfGE 7, 198 – Lüth, 15
Jan 1958). While Lüth had lost the civil case regarding his call for
boycott, the Constitutional Court now upheld his claim to free
speech. The court generally extended the controlling power of basic
rights to the domain of private law by requiring an interpretation
of contractual obligations and other private interaction that is
compatible with fundamental rights, e.g., with the right to free
speech. Ever since 1958, not only cases of administrative courts or
criminal courts, but also all civil cases can end up before the
Constitutional Court.
c) The First Abortion Case
Within the setting of the first abortion case, the Constitutional
Court had to decide whether fundamental rights also resulted in a
duty to protect (BVerfGE 39, 1 – Abortion I, 25 Feb 1975). The court
held that unborn children have the fundamental right to life and
are not only to be protected against the state, but also against any
life threatening behavior of others. Accordingly, the state has a duty
to protect the unborn life against an abortion attempt by the mother
and may, as a measure of last resort, even use criminal law to
enforce this protection.
d) The Population Census Case
The dynamic of 'constitutionalization' is evident in the
Constitutional Court's practice of acknowledging unwritten
fundamental rights by combining older provisions of the Basic
Law. The Right to Informational Autonomy [Informationelle
Selbstbestimmung], for example, was created as a combination of
Personal Autonomy (Art. 2 I GG) and Human Dignity (Art. 1 I GG)
in the case about an extensive Federal Population Census (BVerfGE
65, 1 – Population Census, 15 Dec 1983). The court held that under
the conditions of computerized data collection, each person had to
have a prima facie right to decide what kind of personal data was
available to others, particularly to state entities.
20 The Basic Law (Grundgesetz)
4. Reunification
As a unique event the Unification Treaty between West and East
Germany provided for the five Eastern States [Länder] to join the
West by extending the Basic Law to their territory (36th
Amendment, 23 Sep 1990). Rather than adopting a new constitution
as suggested by the original text of the Basic Law (old Preamble,
former Art. 146 GG), the State adhesion procedure [Beitritt] (former
Art. 23 GG) was used and that preliminary provision then
abolished. The former East Germany (German Democratic
Republic) simply ceased to exist on the Day of German Unity, i.e.,
the new national holiday (3 Oct 1990), by handing over its
territories to West Germany. The achievement of unity was
formally included into the new Preamble in order to mark the
resulting territory as the permanent limitation of Germany along
the Oder-Neisse line – an important condition in the Two Plus Four
Agreement [Zwei-plus-Vier-Vertrag] about the "Final Settlement
with Respect to Germany" by abolishing the last vestiges of
occupation (12 Sep 1990).
5. Problems
Recent reforms of the Constitution (52nd Amendment, 28 Aug
2006; 57th Amendment, 29 July 2009) did not achieve a
breakthrough in the patchwork character of power sharing
between Federation and States. The convoluted system of
competencies suffers from institutional complication by the limited
power of the Senate [Bundesrat] to veto legislation. A true
bicameral parliament would have embedded in procedure what
now leads to perpetual political power struggle regarding
substantive competencies.
The system of basic rights has been so strongly entrenched by
the jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court that it has by now
gained de facto immunity against significant constitutional
amendments. Minor changes have still been possible, e.g., the
reform of the right to asylum (Art. 16a GG) as well as the
confirmation of benign discrimination practices (Art. 3 GG). But
systemic change of the rather opaque system of restrictions (Art. 19,
Art. 5 II, Art. 8 II GG etc.) will probably never be achieved without
a complete revision of the constitution. The question of a complete
revision [Totalrevision] is itself at issue under the unspecific
procedural rules of the Basic Law (Art. 146 GG).

German People.
11 New version by 36th Amendment (23.9.90), i.e., the unification
amendment. The original text of 1949 avoided the term "Constitution"
and stressed the temporary character of this "Basic Law"; it read
(differing parts in italics):
"Conscious of their responsibility before God and men, moved by the

an equal part in a unified Europe, the German People in the States
[Länder] of Baden, Bavaria, Bremen, Hamburg, Hesse, Lower Saxony,
North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate, Schleswig-Holstein,
Wurttemberg-Baden and Wurttemberg-Hohenzollern, to establish a temporary
state order, by virtue of their constituent power, have adopted this Basic
Law of the Federal Republic of Germany. The German People have also
acted for those Germans who were not allowed to participate. The entire
German People remains obliged to fulfill the unity and freedom of Germany
in free self-determination."

which, on submission to the Senate [Bundesrat], is exceptionally
specified by the Government to be particularly urgent may be
submitted by the latter to the House of Representatives

for deferral according to Sentence 3, six weeks later,121 even though

House of Representatives [Bundestag].
(2) The Senate [Bundesrat] may, within three weeks126 of the receipt
of the adopted bill, demand that a committee for joint
consideration of bills, composed of members of the House of
Representatives [Bundestag] and members of the Senate
[Bundesrat], be convened. [2]The composition and the procedure of
this committee is regulated by rules of procedure to be adopted by
the House of Representatives [Bundestag] and requiring the
consent of the Senate [Bundesrat]. [3]The members of the Senate
[Bundesrat] on this committee are not bound by instructions. [4]
Where the consent of the Senate [Bundesrat] is required for a bill to
become a statute, the House of Representatives [Bundestag] and
the Government may also demand that the committee be
convened. [5]Should the committee propose any amendment to the
adopted bill, the House of Representatives [Bundestag] again votes
on the bill.
(2a) Insofar as a statute requires the consent of the Senate
[Bundesrat], the Senate [Bundesrat], if no demand according to
Paragraph II 1 was issued or if the committee for joint
consideration has concluded its procedures without suggesting
changes, has to debate about its consent within adequate time and
reach a decision.127
(3) Insofar as the consent of the Senate [Bundesrat] is not required
for a bill to become a statute, the Senate [Bundesrat] may, when the
proceedings under Paragraph II are completed, enter an objection
within two weeks against a bill adopted by the House of
Representatives [Bundestag]. [2]The period for entering an objection

majority of the members of the House of Representatives
[Bundestag]. [2]Where the Senate [Bundesrat] adopted the objection
with a majority of at least two thirds of its votes, its rejection by the
House of Representatives [Bundestag] requires a majority of two
thirds, including at least the majority of the members of the House
of Representatives [Bundestag].
Article 78 [Adopting Bills]
A bill adopted by the House of Representatives [Bundestag]
becomes a statute where the Senate [Bundesrat] consents to it, or
fails to make a demand pursuant to Article 77 II, or fails to enter an
objection within the period stipulated in Article 77 III, or
withdraws such objection, or where the objection is overridden by
the House of Representatives [Bundestag].
Article 79 [Amendment of the Constitution]
(1) This Constitution can be amended only by statutes which
expressly amend or supplement the text thereof. [2]In respect of
international treaties, the subject of which is a peace settlement, the
preparation of a peace settlement or the phasing out of an
occupation regime, or which are intended to serve the defense of
the Federal Republic, it is sufficient, for the purpose of clarifying
that the provisions of this Constitution do not preclude the
conclusion and entry into force of such treaties, to effect a
supplementation of the text of this Constitution confined to such
clarification.129
(2) Any such statute requires the consent of two thirds of the
members of the House of Representatives [Bundestag] and two
thirds of the votes of the Senate [Bundesrat].
(3) Amendments of this Constitution affecting the division of the
Federation into States [Länder], the participation on principle of the

otherwise provided by federal legislation, for ordinances of the
Government or a Minister concerning basic rules or charges for the
use of facilities of postal affairs and telecommunication, concerning
the basic rules for charges and use of facilities of railroads of the
Federation, or concerning the construction and operation of
railroads, as well as for ordinances issued pursuant to federal
statutes that require the consent of the Senate [Bundesrat] or that
are executed by the States [Länder] as agents of the Federation or as
matters of their own concern.130
(3) The Senate [Bundesrat] can submit such bills for ordinances to
the Government that require its consent.131
(4) Insofar as, by or on the basis of federal statutes, Governments of
the States [Länder] are empowered to adopt ordinances, the States
[Länder] are also allowed to regulate the matter by statute.132
Article 80a [State of Defense]  
133
(1) Where this Constitution or a federal statute on defense,
including the protection of the civilian population, stipulates that
legal provisions may only be applied in accordance with this
Article, their application is, except in a state of defense, admissible
only after the House of Representatives [Bundestag] has
determined that a state of tension exists or where it has specifically
approved such application. [2]In respect of the cases mentioned in
Article 12a V 1 & VI 2, such determination of a state of tension and
such specific approval requires a two-thirds majority of the votes
cast.

decision taken with the consent of the Government by an
international body within the framework of a treaty of alliance. [2]

whenever the House of Representatives [Bundestag] so demands
with the majority of its members.

Representatives [Bundestag] not be dissolved, the President may, at
the request of the Government and with the consent of the Senate
[Bundesrat], declare a state of legislative emergency with respect to

had combined with it the motion under Article 68.
(2) Where, after a state of legislative emergency has been declared,
the House of Representatives [Bundestag] again rejects the bill or
adopts it in a version stated to be unacceptable to the Government,

Senate [Bundesrat] consents to it. [2]The same applies where the bill
is not passed by the House of Representatives [Bundestag] within
four weeks of it.s reintroduction

[2]After the expiration of this period, a further declaration of a state
of legislative emergency is inadmissible during the term of office of
the same Chancellor.
(4) This Constitution may not be amended nor repealed nor
suspended in whole or in part by a statute enacted pursuant to
Paragraph II.

where such consent is refused, with the consent of the Senate
[Bundesrat], also to subordinate authorities.
(4) Should any shortcomings which the Government has found to
exist in the execution of federal statutes in the States [Länder] not
be corrected, the Senate [Bundesrat] decides, at the request of the
Government or the State [Land] concerned, whether such State

of execution. [2]The Government may, for this purpose, require the
submission of reports and documents and send commissioners to
all authorities.
Article 86 [Direct Federal Administration]
Where the Federation executes statutes by means of direct federal
administration or by federal corporate bodies or institutions under

accordance with the provisions of Article 89, the administration of
federal waterways and of shipping is conducted as matters of
direct federal administration with their own administrative
substructures.137 [2]Federal legislation may be enacted to establish
Federal Border Guard authorities and central offices for police
information and communications, for the criminal police and for

constitution and of protection against activities on federal territory
which, through the use of force or acts preparatory to the use of
force, endanger the foreign interests of the Federal Republic of
Germany.138
(2) Social insurance institutions whose sphere of competence
extends beyond the territory of one State [Land] are administered
as direct federal corporate bodies under public law. [2] Social
insurance institutions whose sphere of competence extends beyond
the territory of one State [Land], but not beyond that of more than
three States [Länder], are administered, differing from the first
sentence, as direct State [Land] corporate bodies under public law

involved.139
(3) In addition, independent federal higher authorities as well as
new federal corporate bodies and institutions under public law
may be established by federal legislation for matters on which the
Federation has the power to legislate. [2]Where new functions arise
for the Federation in matters on which it has the power to legislate,
federal authorities at the intermediate and lower levels may be
established, in case of urgent need, with the consent of the Senate
[Bundesrat] and of the majority of the members of the House of
Representatives [Bundestag].

(2) Apart from defense, the Armed Forces may only be used insofar
as explicitly permitted by this Constitution.
(3) While a state of defense or a state of tension exists, the Armed
Forces have the power to protect civilian property and discharge
functions of traffic control insofar as this is necessary for the
performance of their defense mission. [2]Moreover, the Armed
Forces may, when a state of defense or a state of tension exists, be
entrusted with the protection of civilian property also in support of
police measures; in this event the Armed Forces cooperate with the
competent authorities.
(4) In order to avert any imminent danger to the existence or to the
free democratic basic order of the Federation or a State [Land], the
Government may, should conditions as envisaged in Article 91 II
obtain and the police forces and the Federal Border Guard be
inadequate, use the Armed Forces to support the police and the
Federal Border Guard in the protection of civilian property and in
combatting organized and militarily armed insurgents. [2]Any such
use of the Armed Forces has to stop whenever the House of
Representatives [Bundestag] or the Senate [Bundesrat] so demands.

construction work are not assigned to the Federal Armed Forces
Administration except by federal legislation requiring the consent

statutes to the extent that they empower the Federal Armed Forces
Administration to interfere with rights of third parties; this does
not apply, however, in the case of statutes concerning personnel
matters.
(2) Moreover, federal statutes concerning defense, including
recruitment for military service and protection of the civilian
population, may, with the consent of the Senate [Bundesrat],

consent of the Senate [Bundesrat], provide that the powers vested
in the Government or appropriate highest federal authorities by

Paragraphs V and Va respectively. [2]The Federation and the States
[Länder] equally share the revenues from income taxes and
corporation taxes. [3]The respective shares of the Federation and the
States [Länder] in the revenue from the turnover tax are
determined by a federal statute requiring the consent of the Senate
[Bundesrat]. [4] Such determination is based on the following
principles:
1. The Federation and the States [Länder] have an equal claim to
coverage from current revenues of their respective necessary
expenditures. [2]The extent of such expenditures is determined
giving due consideration to financial planning for several
years ahead.

(4) The respective shares of the Federation and the States [Länder]
to the revenue from the turnover tax are newly apportioned
whenever the relation of revenues to expenditures in the
Federation develops substantially differently from that of the States
[Länder]; this does not apply to reduced tax revenues which are
included into the calculation of the apportionment of value added
tax according to Paragraph III 5.189 [2]Where federal legislation
imposes additional expenditures on or withdraws revenue from the
States [Länder], the additional burden may be compensated for by
allocation of federal grants under a federal statute requiring the
consent of the Senate [Bundesrat], provided such additional burden
is limited to a short period of time. [3]Such statute lays down the
principles for calculating such grants and distributing them among
the States [Länder].
(5) A share of the revenue from the income tax belongs to the
communes, to be passed on by the States [Länder] to their
communes on the basis of income taxes paid by the inhabitants of
the latter. [2]Details are regulated by a federal statute requiring the
consent of the Senate [Bundesrat]. [3]Such statute may provide that
communes assess the rate which is applicable to this communal
share.
(5a) From 1 Jan 1998, a share of the revenue from the turnover tax
belongs to the communes. [2]This share is to be passed on by the
States [Länder] to their communes on the basis of an index about
locality and economic power. [3]Details are regulated by a federal
statute requiring the consent of the Senate [Bundesrat].190
(6) Revenue from taxes on real estate and on local industry and
trade belongs to the communes; revenue from local excise taxes
belongs to the communes or, as may be provided for by State
[Land] legislation, to associations of communes. [2]Communes are
authorized to assess, within the framework of the relevant statutes,
the rates at which the taxes on real estate and on local industry and
trade are levied locally. [3]Where there are no communes in a State
[Land], revenue from taxes on real estate and on local industry and
trade as well as from local excise taxes belongs to the State [Land].

a federal statute requiring the consent of the Senate [Bundesrat].
[6]In accordance with State [Land] legislation, taxes on real estate
and on local industry and trade as well as the communes' share of
revenue from the income tax may be taken as a basis for calculating
the amount of apportionment.
(7) An overall percentage, to be determined by State [Land]
legislation, of the State [Land] share of total revenue from joint
taxes belongs to the communes or associations of communes. [2]In
all other respects State [Land] legislation determines whether and
to what extent revenue from State [Land] taxes belong to
communes or associations of communes.
(8) Where in individual States [Länder] or communes or
associations of communes the Federation causes special facilities to
be provided which directly result in an increase of expenditure or a
loss of revenue (special burden) to these States [Länder] or
communes or associations of communes, the Federation grants the
necessary compensation where and insofar as such States [Länder]
or communes or associations of communes cannot reasonably be
expected to bear such special burden. [2] In granting such
compensation, due account is being taken of third party
indemnities and financial benefits accruing to the States [Länder] or
communes or associations of communes concerned as a result of
provision for such facilities.
(9) For the purpose of this Article, revenues and expenditures of
communes or associations of communes are deemed to be State
[Land] revenues and expenditures.

[Bundesrat] may provide in detail for the delimitation as well as
the manner and scope of allotment of local revenue from
corporation and wage taxes. [3]Such statute may also provide for the
delimitation and allotment of local revenue from other taxes. [4]The
State [Land] share of revenue from the turnover tax belongs to the
individual States [Länder] on a per capita basis; a federal statute
requiring the consent of the Senate [Bundesrat] may provide for
supplementary shares not exceeding one quarter of a State [Land]
share to be granted to States [Länder] whose per capita revenue

[Länder] combined; in the case of real estate transfer tax, the
difference in revenue has to be taken into account.195

between financially strong and financially weak States [Länder] is
achieved; due consideration being given to financial capacity and
financial requirements of communes or associations of communes.
