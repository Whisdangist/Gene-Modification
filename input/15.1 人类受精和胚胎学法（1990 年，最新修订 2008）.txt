(2)This Act, so far as it governs bringing about the creation of an embryo, applies only to bringing about the creation of an embryo outside the human body; and in this Act—
[F2(a)references to embryos the creation of which was brought about in vitro (in their application to those where fertilisation or any other process by which an embryo is created is complete) are to those where fertilisation or any other process by which the embryo was created began outside the human body whether or not it was completed there, and]
(b)references to embryos taken from a woman do not include embryos whose creation was brought about in vitro.

44 Civil liability to child with disability.
(1)After section 1 of the M4Congenital Disabilities (Civil Liability) Act 1976 (civil liability to child born disabled) there is inserted—

(1)In any case where—
(a)a child carried by a woman as the result of the placing in her of an embryo or of sperm and eggs or her artificial insemination is born disabled,
(b)the disability results from an act or omission in the course of the selection, or the keeping or use outside the body, of the embryo carried by her or of the gametes used to bring about the creation of the embryo, and
(c)a person is under this section answerable to the child in respect of the act or omission,the child’s disabilities are to be regarded as damage resulting from the wrongful act of that person and actionable accordingly at the suit of the child.
(2)Subject to subsection (3) below and the applied provisions of section 1 of this Act, a person (here referred to as “the defendant”) is answerable to the child if he was liable in tort to one or both of the parents (here referred to as “the parent or parents concerned”) or would, if sued in due time, have been so; and it is no answer that there could not have been such liability because the parent or parents concerned suffered no actionable injury, if there was a breach of legal duty which, accompanied by injury, would have given rise to the liability.
(3)The defendant is not under this section answerable to the child if at the time the embryo, or the sperm and eggs, are placed in the woman or the time of her insemination (as the case may be) either or both of the parents knew the risk of their child being born disabled (that is to say, the particular risk created by the act or omission).
(4)Subsections (5) to (7) of section 1 of this Act apply for the purposes of this section as they apply for the purposes of that but as if references to the parent or the parent affected were references to the parent or parents concerned.”
(2)In section 4 of that Act (interpretation, etc)—
(a)at the end of subsection (2) there is inserted—“and references to embryos shall be construed in accordance with section 1 of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990”,
(b)in subsection (3), after “section 1” there is inserted “1A”, and
(c)in subsection (4), for “either” there is substituted “any”.

Storage of gametes and embryos
8(1)A person’s gametes must not be kept in storage unless there is an effective consent by that person to their storage and they are stored in accordance with the consent.
(2)An embryo the creation of which was brought about in vitro must not be kept in storage unless there is an effective consent, by each [F263relevant person in relation to] the embryo, to the storage of the embryo and the embryo is stored in accordance with those consents.

[F264(2A)Where a licence authorises the application of paragraph 6(3B) in relation to a person who has not attained the age of 18 years (“C”), the effective consent of a person having parental responsibility for C to the storage of an embryo in relation to which C is a relevant person by reason only of the use of C's human cells is to be treated for the purposes of sub-paragraph (2) as the effective consent of C.

(2B)If C attains the age of 18 years or the condition in paragraph 15(3) ceases to be met in relation to C, paragraph 4 has effect in relation to C as if any effective consent previously given under sub-paragraph (2) by a person having parental responsibility for C had been given by C but, subject to that, sub-paragraph (2A) ceases to apply in relation to C.

(2C)For the purposes of sub-paragraphs (2) and (2A), each of the following is a relevant person in relation to an embryo the creation of which was brought about in vitro (“embryo A”)—

(a)each person whose gametes or human cells were used to bring about the creation of embryo A,

(b)each person whose gametes or human cells were used to bring about the creation of any other embryo, the creation of which was brought about in vitro, which was used to bring about the creation of embryo A, and

(c)each person whose gametes or human cells were used to bring about the creation of any human admixed embryo, the creation of which was brought about in vitro, which was used to bring about the creation of embryo A.]

(3)An embryo taken from a woman must not be kept in storage unless there is an effective consent by her to its storage and it is stored in accordance with the consent.
